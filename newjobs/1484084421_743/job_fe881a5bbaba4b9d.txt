Data Scientist, Group Leader

Location: South San Francisco, CA

Department: Informatics

Type: Full Time

Min. Experience: Mid Level

Description: A fast-paced and innovative venture capital funded biotechnology
company seeks an energetic and experienced Data Scientist with a passion for
exploring complex challenges in machine learning for metagenomics
applications.  The ideal candidate for this position will likely have a Ph.D.
degree, or equivalent experience, in CS, Machine Learning, Bioinformatics,
Statistics, Molecular Biology, Microbiology or related field with publications
demonstrating the application of machine learning techniques to novel problems,
ideally to solve molecular biological questions.  This group leader will
manage two other informaticists.  An ability to innovate is a key attribute;
therefore we are looking for a scientist who has advanced the field with novel
approaches in data pre-processing/normalization, feature engineering, feature
selection or novel biological interpretations.

Key responsibilities:

  * Set weekly goals for group and coordinate with Project Managers (diverse
    biologists) to ensure timely delivery of analyses.
  * Meet with internal and external collaborators to plan the scope and
    sequence of ML experiments then oversee feature extraction, feature
    engineering, method selection, parameter tuning, and overall
    interpretation.
  * Prepare internal and external communications (presentations and papers).
  * Implement multiple machine learning approaches to determine the feature
    combinations useful for classification or regression.  Create classifier
    models and estimate performance.  Determine the model?s predictive value
    relative to the purpose.
  * Mine Second Genome?s KnowledgeBase of genomic, metagenomic and
    metatranscriptomic gene sequences to identify sequences matching a
    predictive model. 
  * Incorporate laboratory findings into training data to further refine
    models.
  * AWS cloud deployment of ?big data? processing pipelines.
  * Present results internally and externally to computational biologists and
    molecular biologists, integrate observations and feedback and execute
    follow-up analyses.

Minor responsibilities:

  * High-throughput decomposition of sequence data into hundreds of features
    including structural, physicochemical, and genomic neighborhood attributes.
  * Assist in the design of metagenomics experiments to reveal gene, protein
    and metabolite diversity in complex microbial communities.
  * Annotate proteins using reference databases such as Pfam, KEGG, MetaCyc,
    Uniprot and others.

Required attributes:

  * Able to leverage existing machine learning software packages with
    proficiency in Python/scikit-learn/TensorFlow, R/caret, Scala, Spark, etc,
    to execute analyses in a Linux environment.
  * Experience with software deployment in cloud, especially Amazon AWS (EC2,
    RDS, SQS and S3).
  * Ability to manage multiple fast-paced projects simultaneously.
  * Source code revision control such as SVN, git, or related systems.
  * Four years of machine learning experience.
  * Two years of full time biotech or pharma experience.

Preferred attributes:

  * Ability to analyze large-dimensional data from a variety of meta?omics
    platforms including metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metametabolomics,
    metaproteomics, microarrays and16S rRNA gene profiling.

The ability to work as a team member and a willingness to become part of a
fast-paced, entrepreneurial biotech drug discovery atmosphere is a must. Strong
interpersonal communication skills and self-motivation are highly desirable and
the candidate must demonstrate an understanding of the general business aspects
of a biotech organization. Competitive salary and benefits commensurate with
experience; stock options and annual bonus are part of a compensation package.
