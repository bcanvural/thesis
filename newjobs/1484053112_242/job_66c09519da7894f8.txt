Who You'll Work With

You'll join the Fast Growth Tech team in either Waltham, San Francisco, or
Silicon Valley.  

Fast Growth Tech is part of McKinsey Solutions and McKinsey New Ventures. Fast
Growth Tech is creating and delivering impact for start-ups and their VC and PE
Growth investors. We serve start-ups across a wide range of segments –
everything from B2C to B2B to biotech – on topics from pricing and sales
effectiveness to new market entry. We are looking for people who are passionate
about helping start-ups succeed by both bringing the best of what McKinsey has
to offer to make these companies successful, and building new innovative
solutions.  

The Fast Growth Tech Solutions team is responsible for delivering innovative
solutions that McKinsey can provide to start-up companies and investors
leveraging technology, big data, and analytics.  These solutions will be used
to diagnose issues, identify solutions, deliver impactful results, and develop
new insights and knowledge for startups and their investors.

New Ventures fosters innovation driven by analytics, design thinking, mobile
and social by developing new products/services and integrating them into our
client work. It is helping to shift our model toward asset-based consulting and
is a foundation for – and expands our investment in – our entrepreneurial
culture. Through innovative software as a service solutions, strategic
acquisitions, and a vibrant ecosystem of alliances, we are redefining what it
means to work with McKinsey.

McKinsey Solutions is a core part of New Ventures and offers practical tools
that help people at all levels of an organization generate insights they need
to address both strategic and day-to-day decisions. These solutions complement
McKinsey's traditional client service and are delivered in many ways, including
subscriptions, workshops, training programs and project-based engagements. We
work closely with clients to embed our tools, analytics and expertise, and
provide on-going support to help them build the capabilities they need to
revolutionize how decisions are made.

What You'll Do

You will push our solutions further by identifying new ways to leverage our
data, helping us to develop new capabilities, and managing data sharing with
select partners. 

You will use advanced analytical tools to prepare and analyze large data sets
to distill unique insights from FGT’s proprietary data assets, and you'll set
up, run, and analyze results for multiple solutions including benchmarking for
enterprise and consumer start-ups, sales performance assessment, and other
solutions.

Additionally, you'll answer pressing questions by developing and testing
hypotheses based on our data, and working closely with SMEs to identify,
refine, and deliver relevant analyses. You'll meet client needs by performing
additional analysis to support and respond to client asks, and preparing
client-ready output for delivery and participate in client meetings.
Furthermore, you'll have the opportunity to provide thought leadership on
Analytics to subject matter experts and product managers, who will rely on your
input for how to structure questions, refine data collection, determine the
most interesting analyses, and deliver effective insights.

You'll stay on the cutting edge of your field by keeping current with the
latest analytical tools, data sources, and trends, and incorporating the most
effective ones into our work. Your work will be interdisciplinary - you'll have
the chance to work across a variety of topics, demonstrating an ability to
apply your analytical capabilities to developing insights in new areas where
you may not at first have expertise.
