About Us

Atlas Informatics is a startup in Seattle with an audacious goal to redefine
search as we know it. Atlas Recall, the company’s first product, is a personal
search engine that helps you find EVERYTHING you have seen across all of your
devices, apps and cloud services. Recall gives you centralized control over
your scattered data saving you time, hassle, and heartache. Two-years running,
the great Atlas team was awarded Seattle Business Magazine 100 Best Places to
Work For.  

About the Role

Atlas Informatics is looking for an experimental research scientist to join our

    culture.
  • Work with the engineering team to implement prototypes in production.
  • Build a smarter platform - stay on top of the latest research and
    techniques, anticipate opportunities for applying them to better our
    product.

Requirements

  • BS in Computer Science or equivalent
  • 5+ years of experience working with machine learning, data mining or
    recommendation systems
  • Familiarity with supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms,
    such as decision trees, logistic regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, kNN
  • Proficient coder who is open to learning new languages - MIG primarily
    works with Python (R&D), Ruby, and Golang

Preferred Qualifications

  • Masters in Computer Science or equivalent
  • Domain expertise in search
  • Familiarity with natural language processing (NLP) problem space and
    techniques, such as stemming and tokenization, topic identification (LDA
    and others), and semantic parsing
  • Experience using Elasticsearch or Lucene
  • Experience with deep learning, using toolkits such as TensorFlow, Theano,
    Caffe
  • Familiarity with data pipelines and processing large quantities of
    streaming data

Bonus:

Atlas Informatics provides competitive compensation, robust benefits, early
stage stock and some of the most talented people you’ll have the pleasure of
working with.
