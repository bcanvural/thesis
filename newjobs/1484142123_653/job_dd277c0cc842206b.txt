Requisition Number    17-0018
Title                 Radar Research Scientist
City                  Dayton
State                 Ohio
Employment Type       Full Time
Hot Job               No
Description           Infoscitex, a DCS company, has an opportunity for a Radar
                      Research Scientist to join our team of professionals
                      supporting our client in the Air Force Research
                      Laboratories (AFRL), Wright- Patterson Air Force Base
                      (WPAFB), near Dayton, Ohio, generating, processing,
                      analyzing and exploiting radar sensor products.

                      In this role, you will be working on-site at WPAFB in the
                      Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) supporting research and
                      development of advanced, state-of-the-art sensor data
                      processing and sensor exploitation algorithms. You will
                      investigate the electromagnetic phenomenology of air- and
                      ground-based targets of interest. You will analyze the
                      accuracy and run time performance of highly
                      computationally intensive algorithms. You will develop
                      and assess techniques to optimize runtime performance to
                      include utilization of GPUs and high performance
                      computing resources. Some intermittent short term travel
                      may be required.
                      
Requirements          Due to the sensitivity of customer related requirements,
                      U.S. Citizenship is required.



                      Applicants selected will be subject to a U.S. Government
                      background investigation and must meet eligibility
                      requirements for access to classified information:
                      ability to attain a Secret level security clearance.



                      At least a BS degree in Engineering, Math, or related
                      technical discipline.



                      At least 1 year of related experience.



                      Experience utilizing numerical methods for implementing
                      algorithms using computer programming languages including
                      C/C++, Matlab and Python.



                      Ability to apply modeling and simulation (M&S) tools and
                      techniques to generate radar signature products.



                      Ability to test and evaluate radar processing algorithms
                      including the formulation and utilization of benchmarks
                      and metrics to guide optimization.

                      Ability to work well in team environments.

                      Ability to work with customers in broad areas of project
                      execution.

                      Ability to travel, if needed.

                      We expect an ideal candidate would also bring:
                      Experience with image formation algorithms for monostatic
                      and bistatic Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR).
                      Experience using the Xpatch computational electromagnetic
                      tool.
                      Experience using high performance computing resources.
