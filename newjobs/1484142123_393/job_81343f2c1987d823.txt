apply your knowledge of the big data landscape and technology to really move
the needle for us across both structured and unstructured data. In addition,
you will have the opportunity to collaborate with other product designers and
business areas within the company to create these new solutions.

You'll need to have:

  * 8+ years of professional industry experience and knowledge of data sourcing
    and distribution products and solutions
  * Demonstrated ability to use data analysis to identify financial market
    opportunities
  * A visionary approach with experience developing and implementing new
    strategies
  * Experience delivering data driven solutions with an ability to extract
    insights from them
  * Ability to build partnerships with cross-functional teams and facilitate
    interactions with engineering, sales, product and support
  * Ability to execute a business plan while remaining responsive to changing
    conditions
  * Ability to lead multiple projects at the same time and shift priorities
    quickly
  * Effective written and verbal communication skills

We?d love to see:

  * Prior experience working with R&D/engineering teams to develop, test and
    release new products
  * Previous collaboration with data scientists
  * Experience formulating investment strategies
  * Experience selling in some capacity
