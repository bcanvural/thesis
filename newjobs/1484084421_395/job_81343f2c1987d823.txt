Data Acquisition Strategy Leader

New York

Posted Dec 23, 2016 - Requisition No. 56293

Apply Now

Bloomberg runs on data. In our Global Data business, we're responsible for
supplying it – our Content Acquisition and Business Management team (CABM) is
all about capturing and integrating data to provide our customers with
information they need. The team is comprised of several groups focused on:
Pricing, Research, Exchanges, Product Development, Contracts, and Market
Structure.

The Role:

We are on the hunt for a unique professional who will lead a team to develop
and implement new and innovative data acquisition strategies. Over the years
our company has created a vast library of data sources for our customers to
access. But we’re not satisfied. We believe there are still untapped resources
in the market when it comes to data sets that could help investors make more
informed decisions. In this role you will help define and roll out new
strategies to identify potential content sources, validate their data, and help
create a scalable onboarding approach.

You will have an opportunity to use your in-depth understanding of financial
markets and investment life cycles to design new strategies for Bloomberg's
data acquisition. You'll know how the buy-side sources content and be able to
apply your knowledge of the big data landscape and technology to really move
the needle for us across both structured and unstructured data. In addition,
you will have the opportunity to collaborate with other product designers and
business areas within the company to create these new solutions.

You'll need to have:

  • 8+ years of professional industry experience and knowledge of data sourcing
    and distribution products and solutions
  • Demonstrated ability to use data analysis to identify financial market
    opportunities
  • A visionary approach with experience developing and implementing new
    strategies
  • Experience delivering data driven solutions with an ability to extract
    insights from them
  • Ability to build partnerships with cross-functional teams and facilitate
    interactions with engineering, sales, product and support
  • Ability to execute a business plan while remaining responsive to changing
    conditions
  • Ability to lead multiple projects at the same time and shift priorities
    quickly
  • Effective written and verbal communication skills

We’d love to see:

  • Prior experience working with R&D/engineering teams to develop, test and
    release new products
  • Previous collaboration with data scientists
  • Experience formulating investment strategies
  • Experience selling in some capacity

Why Bloomberg?

Bloomberg is committed to diversity. It drives our innovation. At Bloomberg,
you'll have the opportunity to go above and beyond and to take risks. You'll be
a part of an organization that is entering new markets, launching new ventures,
and pushing boundaries. Our ever-expanding array of technology, data, news, and
media services fosters innovation and empowers clients -- and offers nearly
limitless opportunities for career growth.
