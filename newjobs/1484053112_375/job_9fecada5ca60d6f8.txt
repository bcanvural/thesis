Who You'll Work With

You’ll work with our Analytics group in Waltham, Massachusetts, co-located with
our Knowledge Center colleagues. As a member of this team, you’ll work with
McKinsey consulting teams to carry out complex data analysis and modeling,
creating a foundation for sound recommendations for client studies and internal
projects.

What You'll Do

You will be a core member of our analytics platform team, responsible for
extracting large quantities data from client’s IT systems, developing efficient
ETL and data management processes, and building architectures for rapid
ingestion and dissemination of key data.

You will be the point person in data architecture and management for our cloud

tool developers, consultants and clients on projects that use complex data and
advanced modeling to solve client problems and deliver significant measurable
impact.

Additionally, you’ll be exposed to an enormous variety of topics across many
different industries such as a world-leading bank figuring out how to best do
its customer care across all of its channels, a railway determining optimal
crew deployment, or a medical care provider understanding the main drivers for
delays in surgery scheduling. Working on projects and exchanging experiences
with your colleagues means you will face new intellectual challenges on a daily
basis, while continuously building your methodological knowledge and skills.
