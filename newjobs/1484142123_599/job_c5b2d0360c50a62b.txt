                         What You Will Do

                          

                         The mission of the Earth and Environmental Sciences
                         (EES) Division of Los Alamos National Laboratory is to
                         solve complex problems of importance in environment,
                         energy, and national security by using our
                         capabilities in earth and environmental sciences. The
                         division is a highly interactive, well-funded research
                         organization with an annual budget of approximately
                         $100 million and a staff of approximately 240.  The
                         core disciplines of EES Division include Geology,
                         Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geodynamics, Geography,
                         Hydrology, Atmospheric Science, Ecology, Environmental
                         Science, Computational Science and Geotechnical
                         Engineering. The disciplines are organized into groups
                         within the division, which consist of 30-40
                         Scientists, with approximately 20 support staff,
                         post-docs, and students. 

                          

                         This job posting is for 1 (one) postdoctoral position
                         in the Geophysics Group (EES-17).  EES-17 performs
                         research and development nonlinear acoustics,
                         seismology, fault physics geology and geodynamics.  In
                         this area of research we conduct experimental,
                         theoretical and simulations of fault processes.  We
                         analyze these data applying classical signal
                         processing and machine learning techniques.

                          

                         EES-17 is looking for a creative postdoc to join our
                         interdisciplinary team. The successful candidate will
                         take a role in analyzing experimental, simulation and
                         seismic data applying classical signal processing
                         techniques as especially machine learning and will be
                         expected to conduct research independently, publish
                         results in peer-reviewed journals and present at
                         conferences.
