Data Scientist

at ShopKeep
ShopKeep Headquarters

About Us

Born out of frustration with the traditional cash register business, Shopkeep
was designed by a retailer with a noble aim: to rescue independent business
owners from the nightmare of archaic point of sale systems, and to replace it
with something beautiful, simple, and affordable. It turned out that by doing
this, we were giving our fellow merchants a fighting chance against the big
guys, so we kept doing it.

Today, our mission is simple: empower independent business owners to dream big
and fight smart. We?re doing this by disrupting the industry through our
cloud-based architecture, amazing customer care, and intuitive software that
delivers the data small business owners need to run smarter businesses.

At Shopkeep, we?ve been successful because of our awesome team that believes
small businesses make up the heart of their communities. If you want to defend
the independent spirit of ?Main Street,? you?ve come to the right place.

About This Role

ShopKeep's customers are business owners themselves and need actionable
intelligence as much as us; the Data Science team builds internal and external
data products to service our merchants and our company alike. We're still
small, so you should be comfortable working on a variety of things. This role
is not pure analysis; some days you?ll be in the Python weeds doing things like
writing tests for an API client.

What You Will Do

  * Build machine learning models and productionize them yourself. Currently,
    we build models to: predict customer retention, offer merchants insight
    into how they compare with each other, improve sales and customer care
    operational flows, and more.
  * Work directly with Product to build data scientific solutions that empower
    our merchants.
  * Design and implement statistical experiments around business decisions.
  * Build pipelines to pull in new sources of data for your models in a way
    that is scalable and robust. Manage / debug previously written pipelines.
  * Help tens of thousands of growing businesses get smarter.

What You Need

  * Experience building and productionizing predictive models with Python
  * Appreciation for testing and TDD
  * Comfort with a git-based workflow
  * Fluency with Python / Pandas and a deep desire to improve
  * Understanding of probability, simulation, and statistical inference
  * Experience writing SQL

Bonus Points If You?re Experienced With

  * Time series modeling
  * NLP and word2vec
  * Data visualization / exploration tools (especially Looker)
  * Columnar databases (especially Redshift)
  * Document databases (especially Elasticsearch)
  * AWS
  * Postgres
  * Apache Spark
  * Designing data architecture from table to dashboard
  * Side projects
  * Graduate school

Our Offer

  * Competitive salary and equity
  * Opportunity to focus and work on the problems that most interest you
  * Career growth
  * Benefits package with subsidized health, dental, and vision plans
  * NYC startup perks like catered lunch, bagels, yoga, bootcamp, meditation,
    beer on tap, and hackathons
