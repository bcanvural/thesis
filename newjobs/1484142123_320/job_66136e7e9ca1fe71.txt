The Intelligence and Decision Technologies Group develops advanced software
techniques for processing, exploitation, and dissemination of data from many
types of sensors, including radar, electro-optic, video, and radio frequency,
as well as from people and the Internet. The goal is to develop and prototype
analytics and architectures that support decision makers. This work begins with
an understanding of the workflows of intelligence analysts and military
commanders, often through operations research. Operational data sets are
amassed to support all types of algorithm development, such as multi-sensor
fusion, data mining, graph-based network detection, and entity tracking. An
agile development methodology then creates prototype systems for data
exploitation and knowledge management which are then delivered to our user
community for feedback and iterative refinement. The challenges of
heterogeneous sensor systems and overwhelmingly large data volumes drive
experimentation with architectures for network-centric exploitation and
distributed storage and computation. Areas of technical staff expertise in the
group include machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing,
graph analytics, distributed software systems analysis and development,
modeling and simulation, software development, and field experimentation.

 A research position is currently available to develop automated intelligence
systems for large multi-sensor and open source data sets. Projects involve
system design and architecture and the development of algorithms for machine
learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and graph analytics
implemented on enterprise big data architectures.  Data Scientists and/or
Software Engineers/Architects are encouraged to apply.

 

Position Requirements

 

  * MS or PhD in Computer Science, Engineering, Mathematics, Statistics or
    Physics (with emphasis in Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning,
    Computer Vision or Natural Language Processing).
  * In lieu of the above, a minimum of 5-8 years of directly related experience
    will be considered.
  * Proficient mathematical skills, significant experience with machine
    learning and programming competence in one or more high-level languages
    (e.g. Java/Python/C++/ MATLAB).
  * Candidates must be experienced in working within a team-oriented
    environment and have strong interpersonal skills, including oral and
    written communication.
  * Familiarity with remote sensing technologies or military Intelligence,
    Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems is a plus.
  * Occasional travel may be required.
