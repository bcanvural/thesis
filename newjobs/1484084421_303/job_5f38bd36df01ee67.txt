Work With Us

At YuMe, we don't take hiring lightly. We look for smart, determined,
hard-working people. At minimum, some would describe us as "smart and fun".
YuMe employees are smart but also know how and when to have fun. The
initiatives we are doing over here require deep focus, impressive brain power,
individual contribution and creation, and the ability to enjoy the journey
along the way.

Sorry, iframes are not supported.

A note to recruiters: YuMe does not accept unsolicited resumes from search or
recruiting firms with whom we have no formal relationship. Unsolicited resumes
submitted by a third party search or recruiting firm will become the property
of YuMe.
