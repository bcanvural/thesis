Apply for this job

We have millions of learners on our platform learning everyday; this
unprecedented access to learning data provides us with an opportunity to
fundamentally improve education to improve learner outcomes, leveraging the
data we have.

The next generation team develops technology to make learning better: from
advancing assessment technology to deep semantic content understanding and
augmentation to personalized learning.

As a machine learning engineer on the team, you will be responsible for
developing end-to-end machine learning models that will form the foundations of
our future learning experiences.

Your responsibilities

      □ Developing machine learning models that fit our unique problems,
        including training and inference algorithms.
      □ Productionizing models so that multiple product features can leverage
        them.
      □ Research into new machine learning methods and algorithms.
      □ Interfacing with our data infrastructure to create necessary datasets
        and data pipelines.
      □ Building high leverage tools for data collection, model training/
        testing, feature extraction, and more.

Your skills

      □ Strong background working with machine learning, probabilistic
        graphical models, and natural language processing methods.
      □ Have developed ML algorithms independently and understand how they work
        deeply.
      □ Able to read recent ML research papers and adapt those models to our
        context.
      □ Strong programming skills.
      □ Bonus: Prior experience working with educational models and data.
