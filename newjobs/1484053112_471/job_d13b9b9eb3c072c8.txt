importantly, an ability to autonomously plan and organize their work
assignments based on high-level team goals.

Our technology stack includes Python, Scala, Haskell, C++ as well as a wide
range of internal tools built on top of Docker, Kubernetes, Cassandra, Kafka,
Spark, Hadoop, Pandas and a variety of front-end visualization technologies
(D3.js, WebGL, HTML5).

Desired qualifications
• PhD in Engineering degree (computer science, robotics, mathematics,
statistics, machine learning)
• Strong background in classical machine learning and graphical models is a
must, preferably with 3 to 15 years of industrial experience .
• Knowledge of deep learning, reinforcement learning and natural language
processing is a plus.
• Hands-on experience of Linux and Shell scripting, ability to manipulate
large-scale structured datasets.
• Outstanding programming skills. Experience in functional programming,
reactive and service-oriented architectures is a plus.
• Experience with GPU computing (CUDA) and deep learning libraries (TensorFlow,
Caffe, Theano, etc.) is a plus.
• Excellent English spoken and written skills (C1 level) is a must.

Why Cisco
We connect everything: people, processes, data, and things. We innovate
everywhere, taking bold risks to shape the technologies that give us smart
cities, connected cars, and handheld hospitals. And we do it in style with
unique personalities who aren’t afraid to change the way the world works,
lives, plays and learns.

few purple haired rock stars. We celebrate the creativity and diversity that
fuels our innovation. We are dreamers and we are doers.

We Are Cisco.
