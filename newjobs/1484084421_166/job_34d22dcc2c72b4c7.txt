      □ You love building new products and can take an idea from inception, to
        development and production 
      □ You’re a team player and an effective communicator

What you'll do:

      □ Research new algorithms for real-time anomaly/breakout detection 
      □ Collaborate with colleagues across multiple teams on unique challenges
        at scale 
      □ Research new algorithms to assess the efficacy of marketing campaigns 
      □ Research and develop methodologies to guide marketing strategies 
      □ Research and develop algorithms to analyze high velocity streaming
        data 
      □ Design and evaluate experiments to monitor key product metrics,
        understand root causes of changes in performance 
      □ Build user behavior models to guide product roadmaps

      □ 3+ years experience with statistical modeling and validation 
      □ 3+ years experience with R/Matlab/Python 
      □ Experience mining data streams and frameworks (such as Spark streaming)
        is a plus 
      □ Experience developinga nomaly and/or breakout detection algorithms
      □ Contributions to opensource (e.g., R packages) is a big plus

What you'll play with:

      □ Massive amounts of real-time production data from the world’s largest
        social game 
      □ R/Matlab/Python 
      □ Data stores such as Redis, Cassandra, MySQL 
      □ Diverse sets of other technologies (such as MapR, Erlang)
