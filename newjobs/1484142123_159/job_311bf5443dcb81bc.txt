 Our Health and Demographics serves as the central setting

 series of statutes and agreements, agencies and
 organizations entrust their data systems with Health and
 Demographics. These agencies and organizations recognized
 the need to better understand disparities that exist in
 health, education, law enforcement and social services and
 became the driving force to integrate data from these
 systems. The Integrated Data System enables the analysis of
 the use of services and crossover by individuals among
 these agencies and organizations, adds a new dimension to
 information for program management and evaluation, and
 allows for identification and longitudinal analysis of
 cohorts of interest. The philosophy for the integrated data
 system: "It is the entire human experience that influences
 health and social well-being and should therefore be
 captured in an integrated data system."  The use of data
 must be approved by the appropriate participating agencies
 and organizations. 
  
             Minimum and Additional Requirements:
 A master's degree in statistics, biostatistics, or
 biometry; or a master's degree or bachelor's degree in a
