Who You'll Work With

You?ll work with our Consumer Marketing Analytics team in either Waltham (MA)

value-creating insights from big data.

What You'll Do

You will collaborate with colleagues and clients to create new strategies
across a wide platform of projects, from customer life-cycle management, MROI,
pricing and promotions, marketing mix modeling, to analytic transformation.

You will help to expand our current analytic capabilities and architect new
strategies and applications within a dynamic innovative organization. You will
shape the future of what data-driven organizations look like, drive processes
for extracting and using that data in creative ways, and create new lines of
thinking within an infinite number of clients and situations, with an eye on
optimizing every aspect of our clients? marketing practices.

Through the measurement, manipulation, reporting and dissemination of broad
sets of data, you will create valuable, transformative business strategies.
You?ll apply and advise teams on the state-of-the-art advanced analytic and
quantitative tools and modeling techniques in order to derive business
insights, solve complex business problems and improve decisions.

As a core member of the consulting team, you?ll conduct deep analytics on a
broad set of client and external data and play a lead role in team problem
solving through findings and insights from that analysis.

You?ll also have the opportunity to lead and support the development of
knowledge for our firm?s analytic group. You may do this by creating a roadmap
for a greater understanding of analytics and its impact in the consulting
population or by partnering with other analytic consultants to ensure timely
and effective methods of the extraction, assembly and transfer of broad,
complex sets of data.
