Apply for this job

NAUTO is an autonomous car startup on a mission to make better drivers out of
us all and cities safer and more efficient. We're looking for engineering and
business professionals  who love to design, build and scale real-time
distributed systems to join our growing team in Palo Alto.
 
Merging artificial intelligence with computer vision, NAUTO?s systems detect
and react to what?s happening on the road ahead of a driver and within the
vehicle.  NAUTO algorithms sense when there is an issue on the road ahead, or a
distraction within the vehicle, and helps the driver respond. NAUTO also
automatically understands when a collision is about to happen, and records the
scene inside and outside of the car. Then images and data about the incident
are stored in the cloud, and can be shared via NAUTO?s app and fleet management
tools.
 
NAUTO is selling to automobile OEMs, insurance providers and commercial fleets.
Its systems are running on several classes of high-volume commercial vehicles.
Investors in our recent A-round included Andy Rubin?s Playground Global, Draper
Nexus and strategics such as BMW, Toyota, and Germany?s largest insurer,
Allianz.
 
Long-term NAUTO will continue to partner with auto manufacturers to evolve its
systems from an on-board safety AI into a platform that becomes the brain
controlling autonomous vehicles.

Responsibilities:

      +     Design and maintain well-structured relational database schemas.
