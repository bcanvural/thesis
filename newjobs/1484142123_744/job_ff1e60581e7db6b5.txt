Position Description

At Toptal, we measure everything and always rely on data to guide all of our
initiatives, including both our long-term strategy and our day-to-day
operations. As a Data Scientist on our Analytics Team, you will be working with
our team to model complex problems, discover actionable business insights, and
identify high-impact opportunities. You will be part of a high-energy,
fast-paced team responsible for supporting initiatives and operations across
the company.

This is a remote position that can be done from anywhere. However, we do things
like rent out hotels in Africa or mansions in Thailand, and you will certainly
be invited to come work with us.

Responsibilities:

  * Use statistical, algorithmic, data mining, and visualization techniques to
    model complex problems, discover actionable business insights, and identify
    opportunities.
  * Architect specialized database and computing environments.
  * Handle both parts of the Research & Development process, including clean,
    rigorous implementations of devised models inside our Analytics system.
  * Take smart risks and champion new ideas.
  * Be in constant communication with team members and other relevant parties
    and convey results efficiently and clearly.

Requirements:

  * A strong background in mathematics, in particular in probability theory and
    statistics, data mining, and machine learning.
  * A proven record of quickly and accurately understanding complex new
    concepts.
  * Extensive experience with a programming language of your own choice (R,
    Python, Matlab, etc.) and a strong record of efficiently conducting
    research and creating ad hoc reports.
  * An excellent ability to learn new programming languages quickly and
    effectively.
  * Strong experience managing or shipping out a product, managing a team, or
    working on open source projects are all big pluses.
  * Be excited about collaborating daily with your team and other groups while
    working via a distributed model.
  * Be eager to help your teammates, share your knowledge with them, and learn
    from them.
  * Be open to receiving constructive feedback.
  * You must be a world-class individual contributor to thrive at Toptal. You
    will not be here just to tell other people what to do.
