Research Scientist, Computer Vision

Research | Redmond, Washington

Oculus is a world leader in the design of virtual reality systems. We are
currently seeking innovative researchers with a passion for technology to
achieve great strides in general scene perception at our research location in
Redmond, WA. Within the Oculus Research Surreal Vision team, the aim of this
role focusses on formulating a new generation of end-to-end real-time 3D scene
understanding systems working across novel mobile sensor design, state
estimation, computer vision and large scale online inference and optimization.
The position requires a PhD in computer vision or machine learning with a
combination of theoretical expertise and applied experience in mathematical
optimization, computer vision, algorithm design and machine learning. The ideal
applicant will have demonstrated the skill of significant research innovation
as well as the capability of building strongly proven prototype systems.

Responsibilities

  * Plan and execute cutting edge research to advance the state of the art in
    online learning and inference methods.
  * Develop new advanced technologies and scientific concepts to enable
    advanced general scene understanding in collaboration with other
    researchers and engineers.
  * Work with the team to help design, setup, and run practical experiments
    related to large scale long-duration perceptual reasoning.
  * Collaborate with other researchers and engineers to develop experiments and
    concepts that advance the entire project.

Minimum Qualification

  * PhD and/or postdoctoral assignment in the field of Computer Vision, Pure
    Mathematics, or Machine Learning or related field
  * Graduating with a PhD, or completing a university postdoctoral assignment,
    by summer 2017
  * 2+ year experience with statistical analysis of data and mathematical
    modeling
  * 2+ years experience with developing machine learning, Bayesian filtering,
    information theory, 3D geometry, and physics based simulation
  * 3+ years experience with system building in C++, including evaluation
    design
  * A documented history of increasing responsibilities and decision-making
    experience
  * Interpersonal skills: cross-group and cross-culture collaboration
  * Ability to obtain work authorization in the United States in 2017

Preferred Qualifications

  * Experience with virtual reality research
  * Demonstrated software engineer experience via an internship, work
    experience, coding competitions, or widely used contributions in open
    source repositories (e.g. Github)
  * Proven track record of achieving academic results, including papers at
    conferences such as CVPR, ECCV/ICCV, SIGGRAPH, NIPS, etc.
