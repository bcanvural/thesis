It has come to Nielsen's attention that individuals misrepresenting themselves
as Nielsen representatives have offered fradulent employment opportunities. In
some cases, job seekers are asked to pay a processing or work permit fee in
order to secure an offer of employment. Nielsen and our external recruiting/
placement partners will never request credit card information or charge
candidates an up-front fee of any kind.

If you receive a fradulent employement request, save the message and send it to
your local law enforcement agency.
