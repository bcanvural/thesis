Cairn Biosciences is delivering next-generation live cell-based assays to guide
the efficient and rapid discovery and optimization of safe and efficacious
medicines for serious diseases. We provide the only high-throughput assay
platform that rapidly pinpoints compound mechanism of action and potential
toxicities through its unique ability to monitor multiple facets of previously
inaccessible biology in live cells in real-time.

We are seeking an innovative and goal-oriented Scientist with demonstrated
expertise in image and data analysis to lead the development of computer vision
and machine learning methods for quantitative microscopy and image-based
screening in cellular models of human disease. The successful candidate will
have scientific programming experience and be motivated to develop new
learning-based image analysis methods for large-scale microscopy datasets.
Cairn Biosciences fosters a dynamic start-up environment where self-driven,
enthusiastic employees thrive. The successful candidate will be a highly
collaborative and effective team player who is motivated to own projects that
will directly impact Cairn Biosciences? future success.

Key responsibilities
? Implement computational analysis on microscopy image datasets to provide for
robust and testable hypothesis from analyzed experimental data.
