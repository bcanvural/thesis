Haskell Data Scientist

apply now Job ID BUS000143 Date posted 04/22/2016 Location Sunnyvale,
California – United States
Description:
At Target, we are surrounded by a wide range of interesting
problems: Supply-Chain Optimization, Inventory Control, Merchandise
Selection, Space Design, Demand Prediction, Price Optimization, to name just a
few. Historically, the retail industry has thrown Operations Research,
Econometric Modeling and Database Design techniques at these problems, with
moderate success. However, at Target, we see an opportunity to boost revenues
and reduce costs of the order of billions of dollars by merging these
traditional techniques with modern and sometimes unusual methods - Machine
Learning, Distributed Computing, Functional Programming, Compilers for
Domain-Specific Languages, Graph Theory, Algorithms on Algebraic
Datatypes, Stochastic Modeling, Control Theory, Differential Equations. Our
problems are challenging and we have to dig deep into each of the areas above
to penetrate our problems. We feel fortunate to be able to explore so much
breadth as well as depth in the structure of our technical work. 
To top it all, our leadership consists of Ph.D.s in Operations Research,
Machine Learning, Algebra, Algorithms and Astrophysics. Our leaders are
obsessed with hard Math problems and dream in Haskell. Our team is not only
technically strong but is also passionate about solving interesting practical
problems in our retail business. 
If you are an experienced Haskell Programmer with a good understanding of
Category Theory (can do magic with Haskell's Typeclasses) and have a flair for
developing Algorithms, this will be your dream job.
