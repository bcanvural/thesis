  • Fraudulent Activity

        We have received recent reports of fraudulent emails purporting to be
        sent from UnitedHealth Group, UnitedHealthcare, or Optum recruiting
        personnel.
         
        The fraudulent emails, which do not originate from any of UnitedHealth
        Group’s email domains, or those of any of its operating divisions,
        supposedly ask recipients to contact the sender to start the company’s
        hiring process by downloading software and/or requesting a fee.
         
        UnitedHealth Group will never request you download software or pay a
        fee of any sort to explore employment opportunities with our company.

        If you wish to verify the legitimacy of any email purporting to have
        been sent by or on behalf of UnitedHealth Group recruiters,  please
