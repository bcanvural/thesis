Careers at Energy Sense Finance

Welcome to Tampa, Florida

The area?s natural beauty is defined by its waterfront, a landscape filled with
lush, tropical foliage and the year-round sunshine and warm weather so typical
of Florida.

Not just another pretty place, Tampa is a vibrant city boasting and hosting a
world class, international airport, professional sports teams, high-end retail,
fine dining experiences, multi-national companies, state-of-the-art medical
facilities, colleges and universities, MacDill Air Force Base and so much more.

That?s not to say it?s all work and no play around here. Tampa knows how to
throw a party, whether hosting a Super Bowl, welcoming the 2013 Republican
National Convention or even the annual Gasparilla pirate festival where the
city is taken over by Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla for a day.

With a cost of living 10% below the national average and housing prices nearly
25% below the national average, this Central Florida West Coast community is
also an ideal place to start a career, start a family or start enjoying
retirement. From the lofts located in Ybor City to the bungalows of Seminole
Heights, and from the high-rise luxury condominiums lining Bayshore Boulevard
to the gated communities of New Tampa, there are living spaces for all
lifestyles.

Plus there are plenty of perks such as parks and playgrounds, museums and arts
districts, golf course and tennis courts, opera and orchestras, aquariums and
zoos and theme parks such as Busch Gardens. Everything needed for a
well-rounded lifestyle is available and easily accessible no matter where you
reside in the Tampa area.
