Title                 Data Scientist
City                  Atlanta
State                 GA
Description           Cotiviti is looking for an industry leading Data
                      Scientist to join a revolution in Healthcare and build a
                      first-in-market analytics capability. This is a
                      pioneering data scientist who will participate in
                      expanding the new analytics backbone of the company.
                      Cotiviti?s first-in-market analytics capability is
                      powered by social networking technology and enables a
                      more efficient experience for both healthcare providers
                      and customers. As a Data Scientist at Cotiviti you will
                      be given the opportunity to work directly with a team of
                      healthcare professionals including analysts, clinicians,
                      coding specialists, auditors and innovators to set
                      aggressive goals and execute on them with the team. This
                      is for an ambitious technologist with the guts,
                      flexibility, and personal drive to succeed in a dynamic
                      environment.

                      Who You Are

                        * Curious: You enjoy peeling apart a problem and
                          examining the interrelationships between data that
                          may appear superficially unrelated.
                        * Creative: You constantly invent and try new
                          approaches to solving problems, which often times
                          have never been applied in such contexts before.
                        * Practical: You explore theories with an eye to the
                          real world application to the business and the
                          potential for improving performance for clients and
                          customers.
                        * Focused: You're intent on designing and testing a
                          technique over periods of days and weeks, discovering
                          what is successful and what should be optimized
                          further. Furthermore, you learn from the failure and
                          trying again.
                        * Determined: You will have both the challenge and
                          opportunity to help design our analytical backend
                          from the ground-up, and therefore must be comfortable
                          as both a team member and a leader in our data
                          science effort.

                      have responsibility for architecting and developing

                      for our business. You will have responsibility for
                      establishing and sustaining processes and practices that
                      support big data and analytics solutions and applications
                      in an open source environment. You should have a passion
                      for creating solutions and driving innovation with an
                      interest in collaborating with team members.  This role
                      demands time spent working independently and as part of a
                      team. You will also focus on specific deadlines defined
