                The need for CO? reduction, the increasing complexity of new
                powertrain systems, and a requirement to achieve the highest
                possible level of process efficiency - along with the need to
                quickly launch new models - are some of the key challenges
                facing the automotive industry now and for the foreseeable
                future.

                Powertrains for light, medium and heavy-duty commercial
                vehicles use an increasing number of complex systems for
                engine, transmission, electric drives, exhaust aftertreatment
                and the respective electronic control systems. The key is to
                balance this complexity with the life cycle cost of the
                vehicle.
