Data Scientist (TS/SCI only)

Charlottesville, Virginia, United States

Description

CCRi is looking for smart, innovative data scientists with analytical and
software engineering skills. We conduct research and development in data mining
and machine learning techniques to solve complex problems and then implement
scalable solutions in data-driven environments.

To us, practicing data science means applying three key skillsets to solve
complex problems: data manipulation (cleaning, formatting, and transformation),
data analysis, and software engineering. Qualified applicants will demonstrate
strength in at least one of these skills, and aptitude and interest in all
three. Data Scientists at CCRi spend a significant portion of their time
implementing applications around our analytics.

In recent projects we have:

  * Designed and implemented a streaming random forest model
  * Applied deep learning to train semantic embedding models, and used these
    models to fuse multi-modal data
  * Designed and implemented an open-source spatio-temporal adapter for
    distributed data stores
  * Built threat prediction systems to predict the location of future
    asymmetric warfare attacks
  * Implemented an analysis tool to harmonize unaligned datasets to support
    marketing intelligence teams
