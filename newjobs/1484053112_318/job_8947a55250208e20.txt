Oculus is a world leader in the design of virtual reality systems. We are
currently seeking innovative researchers with a passion for applied and
fundamental research in fields related to virtual reality at our research
location in Redmond, WA. We are seeking a Postdoctoral Research Scientist for a
joint project between Oculus and FAIR research labs. Individuals in this role
are expected to be recognized experts in identified research areas such as
artificial intelligence, machine learning, computational statistics, and
applied mathematics, particularly including areas such as deep learning,
graphical models, reinforcement learning, computer perception, natural language
processing and data representation. The ideal candidate will have a keen
interest in producing new science to understand intelligence and technology to
make computers more intelligent. The position is a fixed-term (postdoctoral)
contract for 24 months.

Responsibilities

  • Perform research to advance the science and technology of intelligent
    machines
  • Perform research that enables learning the semantics of data (audio,
    images, video, text, and other modalities)
  • Devise better data-driven models of human behavior
  • Contribute research that can be applied to Oculus product development
  • Mentor MS/PhD interns and collaborate with external academic groups to
    advance our research goals
  • Publish research results in top-tier journals and at leading international
    conferences

Minimum Qualification

  • PhD and/or postdoctoral assignment in the field of Audio Engineering and
    Signal Processing, Acoustics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, or
    a related field
  • Graduating with a PhD, or completing a university postdoctoral assignment,
    by spring 2017
  • 4+ years experience in solving analytical problems using quantitative
    approaches
  • 4+ years experience manipulating and analyzing complex, high-volume,
    high-dimensionality data from varying sources
  • Ability to communicate complex research in a clear, precise, and actionable
    manner
  • 3+ years experience in C++, Java or other related language such as Torch
    and TensorFlow
  • Interpersonal skills: cross-group and cross-culture collaboration
  • Able to obtain work authorization in the US for a two-year period beginning
    in 2017

Preferred Qualifications

  • Proven track record of achieving results as demonstrated in publications in
    machine learning, AI, statistics, applied mathematics, data science, or
    related technical fields
  • Demonstrated software engineer experience via an internship, work
    experience, coding competitions, or widely used contributions in open
    source repositories (e.g. Github)
  • Background in time-frequency domain signal processing (for e.g. speech
    processing)
