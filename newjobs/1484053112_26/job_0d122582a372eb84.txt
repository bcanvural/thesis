Riot Games was established in 2006 by entrepreneurial gamers who believe that
player-focused game development can result in great games. In 2009, Riot
released its debut title League of Legends to critical and player acclaim. As
the most played PC game in the world, over 100 million play every month.
Players form the foundation of our community and it’s for them that we continue
to evolve and improve the League of Legends experience. 

We’re looking for humble but ambitious, razor-sharp professionals who can teach
us a thing or two. We promise to return the favor. Like us, you take play
seriously; you’re passionate about games. We embrace those who see things
differently, aren’t afraid to experiment, and who have a healthy disregard for
constraints.

That's where you come in.

As Data Scientist – Machine Learning Platform, you'll develop advanced machine
learning algorithms and statistical models to solve critical problems and help
deliver awesome player experience. You'll partner with product teams to
implement data science models into live production systems. You'll work closely
with software engineers and combine your top-notch modeling and coding skills
to create tools and infrastructure to empower and level-up data science at
Riot.

You are:

  • Educated: you've earned a BS or equivalent in Statistics, Computer Science,
    Math, Physics, or an applied quantitative field and likely added an MS or
    PhD in the same field to keep your BS company; you're more ninja than
    rockstar, preferring precision strikes to chest-thumping grandstanding; you
    have broad knowledge of machine learning, statistics, algorithm design, or
    software engineering
  • Experienced: you've earned badges in statistical modeling, machine
    learning, distributed system, and database; you understand how to
    architect, implement, deploy, and maintain data science intensive
    applications in a cloud environment; you've also aced one or more of: deep
    learning, natural language processing, server architecture, software
    engineering, full stack web development, visualization  – maybe earning a
    byline or two
  • Big data passionate: you have a firm grasp of SQL and NoSQL databases,
    cloud environment, streaming, as well as the Hadoop ecosystem (Hadoop,
    Hive, Spark); you are very curious about the frontier of big data
    technology and committed to exploring the newest
  • Up to code: you write well-abstracted and reusable code in Python, R, Java,
    or Scala; you freely navigate in Linux environment; you can stand up web
    applications with JavaScript; documentation, version control, and code
    review are in your blood
  • Innovative and analytical: you're a skilled lateral thinker, pulling
    insight from data and free-associating yourself into unique perspectives on
    problems that stump lesser innovators
  • A problem solver: you conduct problem reconnaissance and termination with
    the skill and ruthlessness of Bond, but in an elegant, scalable manner; you
    easily identify and troubleshoot problems, quickly resolving issues
  • Player-focused: as a gamer yourself, you know the importance of listening
    to player needs, especially the implicit needs that can only be uncovered
    by analyzing and understanding player data 

You will:

  • Develop tools that will help data scientists and stakeholders more
    efficiently plumb the dark depths of our very deep, very rich data stores
  • Bring data science to life by working with software engineers to architect,
    develop, and deploy production level applications powered by advanced
    machine learning algorithms that can help us improve player experiences
  • Bring data science to people through designing, prototyping, and
    implementing new ways to effectively communicate data science findings so
    that non-tech audiences can enjoy the beauty of advanced machine learning
  • Bring fresh perspective and new dimensions of analysis to bear on the
    challenge of identifying what we could do better; develop algorithms and
    predictive models to solve critical Riot Games problems and validate models
    to ensure proper behavior
  • Work closely with fellow data scientists and engineers to identify
    opportunities and improve our Insights data ecosystem

Don’t forget to include a resume and cover letter. We receive a lot of
applications, but we’ll notice a fun, well-written intro that shows us you take
play seriously.
