Description

Research Engineer/Scientist ? Information Visualization and UI Design

Come join a team of data scientists from diverse backgrounds in a truly
innovative cybersecurity R&D environment. We are developing the next generation
of analysis tools and machine learning algorithms to make a difference in the
world of computer security. We strongly support team members through training,
attending conferences, publishing results, lunch tech talks, and flexible
schedules.

Our work in information visualization explains machine learning algorithms to
cybersecurity domain experts, presents data in easily understood formats, and
enables analysts to explore large, complex datasets. Some examples of our work
include a visual differing tool for access control policies, streaming alert
visualizations from a large scale sensor network, and visual analytic tools for
analyzing malware similarity networks. As a member of the team, you would:

  * Participate in a cutting edge research team.
  * Apply information visualization and HCI principles to build tools that
    analyze large-scale cyber datasets.
  * Perform user-centered design by gathering requirements, collecting
    feedback, and iterating on designs.
  * Build scalable prototypes that solve real-world problems.

Requirements

  * Bachelor?s degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or equivalent
    programming experience.
  * 2-5 years experience (or MS with 1-3 years experience) designing and
    developing graphical user interfaces and data visualizations in a modern
    environment (e.g. the web, Android, or iOS).
  * Excellent understanding of data visualization and HCI principles.
  * 1-3 years experience with web front end development (JavaScript/HTML5/
    CSS3).

Extra Credit

  * Working knowledge of visualization libraries like D3.js; web front end
    frameworks like Angular, React, or Backbone; version control systems like
    Git or SVN; and databases like MongoDB or MySQL.
  * Backend web development experience (Node.js, Python, ORM, SQL, etc.).
  * Familiarity with common machine learning algorithms or the fundamentals of
    probability and statistics.
  * Background in usable security, computer/network security, malware analysis,
    or other areas of cybersecurity.
  * Research experience in information visualization or HCI with publications,
    presentations, or patents.
  * An active DOD clearance.
