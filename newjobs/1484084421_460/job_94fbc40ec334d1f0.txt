Job Description:

Adaptive Biotechnologies empowers revolutionary insights into the adaptive
immune system that will change the course of medicine. Adaptive is at the
forefront of immune-based discoveries. We believe that a better understanding
of the adaptive immune system is transforming the course of medicine, and
impacting therapeutic areas such as oncology, autoimmunity and infectious
diseases among others.

Adaptive combines high-throughput sequencing and expert bioinformatics to
profile T-cell and B-cell receptors. We bring the accuracy and sensitivity of
our immunosequencing platform into laboratories around the world to drive
groundbreaking research in cancer and other immune-mediated diseases. We also
translate immunosequencing discoveries into clinical diagnostics and
therapeutic development to improve patient care.

Adaptive represents 'what's next' in next generation sequencing content and is
looking for innovative, bright talent to fill roles throughout the
organization.

At Adaptive, you'll be challenged, you'll be inspired, and you'll be proud to
be part of a collaborative organization making a real difference in improving
many lives. No matter what your role is, you'll find a diverse, team-driven,
fun culture where your input truly counts!

Representative projects in the scope of this role include:

  * Develop, refine, and extend statistical methods for pairing cognate
    receptor sequences
  * Develop and refine likelihood-based methods for quantitation of rearranged
    lymphoid receptors from high-throughput sequencing data
  * Develop methods for probabilistic annotation and clustering of rearranged
    lymphoid receptor sequences
  * Use machine learning to identify features of lymphoid receptor proteins
    that predict antigen binding specificity

Experience and Skills:

  * Must have completed a Ph.D. in statistics or biostatistics
  * 5+ years? experience with statistical applications in molecular biology or
    genetics
  * 5+ years? experience in scientific programming

Ideal candidates will possess:

  * 4+ years of industry and/or post-doctoral research experience
