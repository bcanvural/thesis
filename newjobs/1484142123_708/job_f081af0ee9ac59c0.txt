Data Science Analyst (Denver, CO)


Our Government and Large Commercial high-profile clients are high-tech
organizations with programs in science, technology, engineering and math. For
these positions, they are asking for us to provide data analysts that are
passionate about transforming and making data usable for new services, business
models, and to help economic development. We are looking for people that
believe data is the new gold.

We are looking for data analysts, data wranglers, data scientists with
excellent leadership, technical, and subject matter expertise qualities.  We
have projects lining up developing research-grade science data algorithms from
in-situ sensors to bringing together data sources from disparate sub-agencies
into enterprise platforms to make available on open-data platforms. We have
projects that are creating data and bigdata prototypes whether it be on CartoDB
geospatial, D3 Sankeys and various libraries, feeding and harvesting RDF
Triplets into catalogs, or integrating into SEO environments. Admittedly, we
have some less sexy data wrangling and janitor tasks that will require more ETL
skills to hone in on.

To boot, we want our analysts to be natural change agents and passionate about
change while empathetic to the clients environment on how they leverage,
mature, and incorporate data products, services, and new capabilities. We want
leaders who can both support the influence of the right change direction while
managing the technical and business analysis and design, and are skilled and
self-motivated with solid domain/subject matter expertise.

Our analysts will be on teams that, through facilitated analysis, work
shoulder-to-shoulder with teammates to come up with the conceptual and logical
design and architecture. Analysts will also be working very closely with client
staff or system integrators to rapidly implement changes or agile release.
Furthermore, we devise and craft strategies and communications solutions to
broadcast and brag about their change efforts and results. This is what we do ?
we bring transformations to life.

Position Requirements:
You will be expected to rapidly ramp-up on client lingo, proactively make
observations of patterns, anomalies, problems, and be customer service focused.
You will be expected to be highly self-motivated and understand you will be
held accountable to commitments. We look for decisive individuals able to
rapidly respond to change requests and able to communicate, track, and escalate
risk. We expect you to be proactive, efficient, and ready to learn quickly in
response to all client and team member needs. This is a bootcamp-type position
setup for growth.

We want you to not only gain technical skills, but also grow your interactive
and client facing skills. All roles will require strong communication and
interactive skills - oral, written, visual especially for triaging conflict,
ideation barriers, mitigating risk, foster thought diversity and team
environment. We expect all our roles to have a mastery of their technical level
at their role whether that be in architectural methods, languages, work
products, consulting techniques, and client culture. If they are not, they need
to demonstrate how they are VERY fast learners.

nerd-dom and technology stack as part of normal vernacular in one or many of
these stacks (with the first being default requirement):

  * Data Transformation ? ETL, perl, python, SQL, FTP, Informatica, SAFE/FME,
