   Title          Computer Scientist, Vision & Learning

   Location(s)    Princeton, NJ

   Employment     Full Time
   Status

   Job            From image capture to situational understanding, SRI’s
   Description    Center for Vision Technologies (CVT) offers end-to-end
                  vision solutions that translate into real-world
                  applications.  Our scientists pioneered real-time,
                  real-world computer vision with  the early development of
                  pyramid/wavelet processing that enabled analysis with
                  unprecedented speed and precision. They continue today
                  with a broad array of advances in visual navigation, 3D
                  scene modeling, and object and activity recognition.

                  The Vision & Learning group in CVT is currently searching
                  for a Computer Scientist to join their group of cutting
                  edge researchers.  This position will conduct basic and
                  applied research on computer vision, image/video
                  processing, artificial intelligence and machine learning,
                  with particular focus on algorithm and system
                  development. You would work closely with a team to
                  develop operational prototype systems based on research
                  and investigate their deployment to challenging,
                  real-world problems.

                  Responsibilities of the position include:

                    • Seek, develop and champion new business opportunities
