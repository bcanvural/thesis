Description

Manufacturing Engineering is responsible for designing the equipment, processes
and data systems of Tesla’s production lines. Improving our systems through the
application of experimental findings is crucial for Manufacturing Engineering
to continue to improve the quality of our increasingly- complicated and
increasingly-tuned production lines.

This role collaborates with other members of Manufacturing Engineering to
improve our most-difficult manufacturing processes and equipment through data
science, experimentation and modeling to drive tangible optimizations to the
production environment.

In addition to designing new processes with Manufacturing Engineers, the
Manufacturing Scientist defines and documents standard techniques for
scientific research in the manufacturing environment. The Manufacturing
Scientist also trains others to improve the sophistication and effectiveness of
their scientific investigations within the organization.

Responsibilities

  • Review academic and industry literature for applicable knowledge.
  • Design experiments to generate empirical optimizations.
  • Analyze existing in-process data to inform process development.
  • Build mathematical models to accelerate future optimizations.
  • Determine what data is collected and how on new production lines.
  • Identify novel techniques for instrumenting equipment to better control
    process.
  • Determine product characterizations methods for durability testing.
  • Educate others on statistical analysis and scientific investigation.
  • Collaborate daily with other members of Manufacturing Engineering.
  • This is an exciting opportunity to build a world class manufacturing
    facility right here in the Bay Area. Tesla is a demanding and fast-paced
    environment where you will work on a critical subsystem of incredibly
    exciting products.
  • The ideal candidate takes pride in his/her work, analytical ability,
    ability to explain technical issues to non-technical people, and attention
    to detail. He/She appreciates an environment where superior work is
    encouraged, noticed and rewarded and where individuals carry tremendous
    responsibility.

Requirements

  • PhD or MS in engineering, physics, mathematics, or equivalent.
  • 5+ years relevant experience. 
  • Excels in experimental design.
  • Excels in data-driven optimizations.
  • Excels in documentation of research and results.
  • Exemplary verbal and written communication skills.
  • Proficiency with data analysis languages such as R, Python, Matlab and/or
    SAS.
  • Proficiency in statistics and data visualization.
  • Proficiency creating process documentation.
  • Able to work under pressure while managing competing demands and tight
    deadlines.
  • Well organized with meticulous attention to detail.
  • Knowledgeable about production quality metrics a plus.
  • Experience in a factory organization a plus.
