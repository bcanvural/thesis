great employee benefits including flight privileges, profit sharing and the

Desired Qualifications

  * 2+ years? experience in a technical professional environment
  * Familiarity with natural language processing and other Text mining concepts
  * Experience with building and implementing recommender systems
  * Ability to view data from different angles to employ feature engineering
