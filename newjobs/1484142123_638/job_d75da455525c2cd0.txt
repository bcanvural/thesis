The concept

Virtually Live is a revolutionary, immersive technology which sits between
attending a live game or event and watching it on TV. Our patented media system
uses tracked statistical data and transposes it into a virtual venue. These
productions may include sporting events in which the objects are players, balls
or vehicles. Equally, performers can be tracked in live events such as music
festivals, concerts and religious festivals.

Initially, Virtually Live is focused on delivering a variety of sport
experiences including soccer and motor racing. Data is streamed optically from
multiple cameras or via GPS in real-time to track the positions of the actors
in the event. This data is used to compute the positions and trajectories of
all of the actors in the event and then render the event in a virtual stadium
allowing any number of virtual participants to attend the event live. Through
the Virtually Live participant-interface, one can witness the event from any
angle including the POV of a race car driver, any player on the pitch.
Participants can access all parts of the Virtual Stadium, make
micro-transactions to buy the latest virtual fan merchandise for their personal
avatar and interact with other virtual participants.

The problem

The crux of the problem is in processing the real-time data obtained from
sensors in the real world into information rich enough to create VR
experiences. The first challenge is related to data integrity - although
technology is continually improving, tracking data cannot be completely
accurate. Moreover due to the use of independent data capture methods, the data
is frequently inconsistent. These data integrity issues need to be identified
and corrected using a variety of analytical approaches. Another challenge is to
determine the actions and/or events from the data streams by applying feature
engineering and machine learning techniques to the game data. The relatively
large number (dozens) of possible events of interest make this especially
challenging. Finally, these methods have to be implemented into a low latency
data processing engine for real-time viewership.

Responsibilities

As a data scientist you will work in a multi-disciplinary, international team
on the challenging problems described above. Some of the responsibilities
include:

  * Perform specialized/advanced data analysis to develop algorithms for
    sense-checking of real time streams
  * Propose algorithms for correction of live sports tracking data. ?Understand
    systematic and random sources of errors and build algorithms to handle
    these while honoring various physical and event constraints
  * Apply machine learning techniques on large data sets of sports data to
    identify events of interest in data
  * Define a reusable toolkit and best practices for data processing of real
    time streaming data
  * Identify new datasets, problems; Propose, prove and implement
    out-of-the-box ideas for solving problems never solved before!
  * Contribute to defining the logic of the production system depending on the
    integrity of the data ?stream

Qualifications

  * Higher degree in a quantitative discipline, e.g., engineering/computer
    science/statistics/applied mathematics/physics. Prefer background in one of
    the following - real time sensor data applications (e.g. wearables, IOT
    etc.), computer vision, robotics, signal processing, machine learning,
    simulation, tracking etc.
  * Experience handling large and high-dimensional data sets
  * Advanced programming experience

Ideal Skills

  * Extensive programming in an analytical language/framework - Python, R,
    Matlab etc.
  * Demonstrable passion for sports ?
  * Passionate about technology development, particularly virtual reality ?
  * Keen to work in a startup culture
  * Interested in the entertainment industry and positive about social media ?

What We Can Offer You

  * Working within a remarkably diverse environment with an equally remarkable
    diverse ?group of international colleagues all of whom are passionate about
    developing novel technologies.
  * Competitive compensation package
  * Comprehensive Health Care Benefits including Medical, Dental & Vision at no
    cost to the employee!
  * A generous PTO policy
  * Monthly Healthy Lifestyle & Commuter Reimbursements
  * 401K Plan
