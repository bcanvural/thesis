Deep Learning / Machine Learning Researcher

San Francisco
Engineering
Full-time
Apply for this job

As one of the first 20 full-time team members, you will develop Enlitic’s next
generation of machine learning algorithms for medical decision making. Our
ideal candidate enjoys translating deep learning techniques into
production-level code.  

About You:

      □ You are capable of working from high-levels of abstraction, such as a
        library in Python, to the low-level high performance code that powers
        those libraries in C++ or CUDA
      □ Your excellent understanding of the foundations of deep learning allows
        you to explain CNNs to a four year old.
      □ You keep up to date with the cutting edge of deep learning research,
        and have experimented with implementing these new architectures
      □ You are capable of managing the trade-off of when to write kludgy
        one-off programs and when to write robust generalizable software
      □ You have implemented a variety of  deep learning architectures with
        excellent results

Once you are here you will:

      □ Build maintainable pipelines for deep learning that can handle
        terabytes of data
      □ Implement modular techniques for deep learning at all levels of the
        stack, from CUDA operations to visualizations of training curves and
        model outputs.
      □ Keep up to date with the cutting edge of deep learning, and transition
        those techniques to the medical domain
      □ Design and build novel models to solve unique medical problems
      □ Participate in a feedback loop to figure out the ways we can use deep
        learning to maximize the impact for patients

Location
This position is based in San Francisco, CA reporting to the CEO

We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do
