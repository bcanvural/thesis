SCOPE OF WORK
The largest agency directorate and supporter of GEOINT Full Time Equivalents
(FTEs) is the Analysis Directorate.  This directorate assists in providing
timely, relevant, accurate GEOINT analysis, data, and services to customers in
support of the national security.  The Analysis Directorate does so by
producing products and technical support that serves the constantly growing
national and international demand for imagery and geospatial
applications—mapping, navigation, environmental monitoring, urban planning,
resource management, homeland defense, national security, and emergency
preparedness.  

The second largest agency directorate and user of GEOINT FTEs is the Source
Operations and Management Directorate.  The Source Directorate provides the
ability to register and adjudicate GEOINT users needs, develop strategies to
acquire or produce all GEOINT sources, and manage/monitor the delivery of all
GEOINT sources to those creating actionable intelligence.  This mission is
accomplished through identifying existing source material in agency holdings or
accessible from our GEOINT partners worldwide, gathering existing geospatial
data and imagery from our US and foreign production partners, and creating
products and data giving the select agency the ability to “Know the Earth ...
Show the Way”.  The Source Directorate is responsible for national satellite
imagery, commercial and airborne imagery and GEOINT foundation data--including
elevation, feature, and gravity data.  Source data is any resource that
contributes to the creation of GEOINT and encompasses imagery, mapping, and any
data describing the Earth’s natural and manmade features, as well as activities
that can be referenced.
