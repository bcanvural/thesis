   Type

   Job            As a member of the Scientific Data Analysis team, you
   Description    will explore and develop machine learning and other
                  advanced analysis approaches for drug discovery
                  applications. You will identify tractable machine
                  learning problems in all stages of drug discovery from
                  understanding basic disease biology, to target
                  identification, assay development, safety, and patient
                  stratification. Working with drug discovery teams and
                  computational biology colleagues, you will frame key
                  questions, define appropriate data sets, and perform data
                  analysis on these projects. You will be a part of teams
                  that bring together leading bench scientists, software
                  engineers, statisticians and bioinformaticians to make
                  sense of large scale experimental data. A successful
                  candidate must demonstrate the ability to work
                  collaboratively, communicate well, and to deliver
                  actionable results.

                  Specific activities include:

                  1.Providing guidance on study design to project teams.
                  2.Applying machine learning algorithms and other advanced
                  analytic methods to drug discovery problems.
                  3.Exploring and understanding relevant datasets, both
                  those generated internally and those from the public
                  domain.
                  4.Communicating data analysis results and methods to the
                  NIBR community and the broader scientific community.
                  5.Staying current with relevant computer science and
                  statistical methods.
                  6.Educating colleagues about the strengths, weaknesses,
                  and drug discovery potential of these analysis
                  approaches.
