The Secret Data Science team* at Salesforce is looking for data connoisseurs to
help us take one of the world's most extensive data sets and transform it into
amazing products that feel like magic. 

A typical day for you might include the following: 

  * Develop best in class infrastructure that is able to ingest and transform
    data at huge scale coming from many different sources in many different
    varieties. 
  * Develop machine learning infrastructure and models that can generalize
    across hundreds of thousands of Salesforce customers, but is expressive
    enough to actually generate high lift. 
  * Brainstorm data product ideas with the data scientists that built some of
    the most exciting data products that hundreds of millions people use every
    day. 
  * Meeting with external customers and understanding their businesses and
    their challenges. 
  * Working with internal product teams to transform and sprinkle machine
    learning fairy dust on their products. 
  * Participate in meal conversations with your team members about really
    important topics, such as: Should the cuteness of panda bears be a factor
    in their survivability? Is love a decision tree or a regression model? How
    far ahead would society be today if we had 12 fingers instead of 10? 

What we don't care about: 

  * We don't care about your education - we have great teammates that "only"
    have an undergrad degree and some that did a post doc. 
  * We don't care about your experience - experience is a great predictor of
    age, not competency. 
  * We don't care about the technologies you already know - our entire stack is
    brand new and we had to learn it from scratch. Of course, if you are a
    world class expert in a field, please mention that. 

What we care about: 

  * You have to love data - this is what we do. We are looking for people who
    are excited about different and unique data sets, and all the ways that
    they could be used in order to improve user experience. 
  * You have to be self sufficient - we operate like a startup, so everyone
    needs to do a bit of everything. A bit of design, product specs, front end,
    back end. You don't need to be an expert, but you need to not shy away from
    these tasks. 
  * The only exception, is coding. We develop real products, and most of it is
    writing code. You need to be an expert in coding. 
  * You have to want to make a difference - we don't like status quo. We are
    looking for people who want to excel at everything they do, while still
    being able to prioritize between the must-haves and nice-to-haves. 
  * You have to be a very quick learner - we face new challenges every day,
    anything that ranges between the operating model of a financial services
    companies to how to make Spark work with the S3 file system. No school
    could prepare you for all of these, so you need to be very quick on your
    feet. 

* We are as secret as the Secret Service 
Salesforce, the Customer Success Platform and world's #1 CRM, empowers
companies to connect with their customers in a whole new way. We are the
fastest growing of the top 10 enterprise software companies, the World's Most
Innovative Company according to Forbes, and one of Fortune's 100 Best Companies
to Work For six years running. The growth, innovation, and Aloha spirit of
Salesforce are driven by our incredible employees who thrive on delivering
success for our customers while also finding time to give back through our 1/1/
1 model, which leverages 1% of our time, equity, and product to improve
communities around the world. Salesforce is a team sport, and we play to win.
Join us!
