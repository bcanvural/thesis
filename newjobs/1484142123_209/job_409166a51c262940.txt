Facebook's mission is to give people the power to share, and make the world
more open and connected. Through our growing family of apps and services, we're

world connect and share what matters most to them. Whether we're creating new
products or helping a small business expand its reach, people at Facebook are
builders at heart. Our global teams are constantly iterating, solving problems,
and working together to make the world more open and accessible. Connecting the
world takes every one of us?and we're just getting started.
