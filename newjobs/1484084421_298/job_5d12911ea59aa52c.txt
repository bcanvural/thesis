RESEARCH DATA ANALYST, Development & Alumni Relations, Research

Tracking Code
    4048/L0216
Job Description
   
    Analyze the data fields in the constituent records of the Development and
    Alumni Relations (DAR) tracking system (Blackbaud CRM) to identify
    prospects with the capacity, inclination, and connectivity to support the
    Campaign at the leadership and principal gift levels. Initially, the
    analysis will follow three primary tracks: 1) analyze already-rated
    prospects for inclination and connectivity; 2) analyze the connectivity
    characteristics of current Campaign donors to identify currently unrated
    prospects that are similar; and 3) determine and assign weighted scores to
    the connectivity characteristics used in track #2. In addition, there will
    be a 'customer service' portion of this position that assists field
    development officers in the identification of prospects for upcoming
    fundraising visits through data analysis. It is expected that after the
    first three tracks have been addressed, the Research Data Analyst, through
    discussions and meetings with other departments within DAR, will identify
    and pursue other potentially promising areas of prospect analysis to
    increase the donor pool and assist the Campaign.
