About ThousandEyes

The name ThousandEyes was born from two big ideas: the power to see things not
ordinarily possible and the ability to collect insights from a multitude of
vantage points. As organizations rely more on cloud services and the Internet,
the network has become a "black box" outside of their control. ThousandEyes
gives organizations visibility and insight into the now borderless network. It
arms them with an accurate understanding of how the network impacts their
applications, users and customers. ThousandEyes is used by some of the world's
largest and fastest growing brands, including 4 of the top 5 SaaS companies, 4
of the top 5 US banks and 3 of the Fortune 5. ThousandEyes is backed by Sequoia
Capital, Google Ventures, Tenaya Capital and Sutter Hill Ventures, with
headquarters in San Francisco, CA.

About the Role

We are looking for a network measurements expert that can apply big data
analysis and advanced visualization techniques to massive volumes of data
collected from some of the largest enterprise and public networks in the world.
You will help us analyze a wide-ranging array of network events, long-term
trends, benchmark service providers, Internet-wide outages, DDoS attacks and
overall network health. The analysis will be used to educate the market on what
really happens in the Internet as well as to improve the inference schemes
within the ThousandEyes product. This role requires a deep domain knowledge of
Internet protocols (DNS, TCP/IP, BGP, HTTP), previous experience with network
measurements and a record of publications in technical conferences in computer
networks.

Requirements:

  * Existing portfolio of network measurement projects
  * Expert knowledge in Internet protocols (TCP/IP, DNS, BGP, HTTP)
  * Expert in Python or Java
  * Experience with MySQL and NoSQL (e.g. Mongo, Hadoop)
  * Superb written, verbal and persuasive communication skills
  * PhD or MS in Computer Science 

A plus if you have:

  * Experience analyzing BGP routing streams
  * Experience with traffic analysis (netflow/IPFIX)
  * Experience with tcpdump and libpcap
  * Experience with distributed/real-time systems
