range of internal tools built on top of Docker, Kubernetes, Cassandra, Kafka,
Spark, Hadoop, Pandas and a variety of front-end visualization technologies
(D3.js, WebGL, HTML5).

Desired qualifications
? PhD in Engineering degree (computer science, robotics, mathematics,
statistics, machine learning)
? Strong background in classical machine learning and graphical models is a
must, preferably with 3 to 15 years of industrial experience .
? Knowledge of deep learning, reinforcement learning and natural language
processing is a plus.
? Hands-on experience of Linux and Shell scripting, ability to manipulate
large-scale structured datasets.
? Outstanding programming skills. Experience in functional programming,
reactive and service-oriented architectures is a plus.
? Experience with GPU computing (CUDA) and deep learning libraries (TensorFlow,
Caffe, Theano, etc.) is a plus.
? Excellent English spoken and written skills (C1 level) is a must.
