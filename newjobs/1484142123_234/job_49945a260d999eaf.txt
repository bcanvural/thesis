Who You'll Work With

You?ll work with our Analytics group in Waltham, Massachusetts, co-located with
our Knowledge Center colleagues. You will work with data scientists, data
architects, consultants and clients on projects that use complex data and
advanced modeling to solve client problems and deliver significant measurable
impact.

What You'll Do

You?ll focus on building the front and back-end connections between our cloud
platform and customer applications.

You will identify the best way to ingest data, which is fast, secure and
requires the least amount of manual labor. You will develop and share best
practices for data integration with the goal of maximizing impact through more
effective and efficient methods ? such as machine learning for auto ingestion.
You?ll be able to do this leveraging your experience in non-SQL,
streaming-data, and real time-enabled environments.

You will be exposed to an enormous variety of topics across many different
industries such as a world-leading bank figuring out how to best do its
customer care across all of its channels, a railway determining optimal crew
deployment, or a medical care provider understanding the main drivers for
delays in surgery scheduling. Working on projects and exchanging experiences
with your colleagues means you will face new intellectual challenges on a daily
basis, while continuously building your methodological knowledge and skills.
