Description

Our company brings together a unique combination of expertise in human computer
interaction, machine learning, and hardware integration to create revolutionary
interactive solutions.


We are looking for a machine learning expert who loves working with sensor
data, loves developing new algorithms, is not afraid of challenging, open-ended
problems, and wants to help us shape the future of touch interaction. You will
be working with a small and highly capable team of machine learning engineers
and will have the opportunity to make a meaningful impact on the growth of a
burgeoning startup.


As a Machine Learning Engineer, your responsibilities will include:

  * Designing experiments to advance our machine learning understanding and
    techniques
  * Running experiments to improve the core algorithms of Qeexo products on
    consumer devices
  * Modeling accuracy of Qeexo products on new hardware and sensor platforms
  * Developing new algorithms to improve our engine calibration process
  * Working with customers to design and implement Qeexo solutions


Ideal Candidate

  * A proven track record of academic and/or industry experience in fields
    related to machine learning and signal processing, particularly in acoustic
    analysis
  * Deep knowledge of statistical and machine learning approaches and problem
    domains
  * Computer Science or EE background (MS or BS) with strong coding ability and
    familiarity with Java, C++ or other OOP language.  (You will not be doing
    production-level coding but you will need to build some prototypes/tools
    for experiments.)
  * Proven success with multiple ML/AI/classification projects (research
    papers, kaggle, open source implementations, etc.)
  * Expertise in one or more specific areas of research: neural nets/deep
    learning, signal processing or digital imaging, ensemble learning and
    system identification
  * Research-minded, ability to run experiments independently and present
    results to leadership
  * Comfortable working in a terminal environment, writing scripts (Bash/
    Python) to process data
  * Experience in mobile or other consumer electronic devices


Skills & Requirements:

  * Machine Learning (expert)
  * Python (expert)
  * Deep Learning (proficient)
  * Ensemble Modeling/Classification (proficient)
  * Signal Processing (familiar)
  * Java (familiar)
  * C (familiar)
  * Data Structures and Algorithms (familiar)
  * U.S. Work Authorization required

Bonus Qualifications

  * Familiarity with acoustics or mechanical wave propagation, signal
    processing, approximation theory, and information theory
  * Understanding of applied mathematics, computational science, computational
    statistics, approximation theory, compressive sensing, representation
    learning, and/or pattern recognition
