     Description    Job Description    The client is a systems and services integrator and specialises in    cyber defence operations; it cares about data analytics but isn't a    data company; CCO offers integrated cyber security products and    services to many private and public service clients.     Previously you will have become competent at tasks like pulling data    out of MySQL databases,  becoming a master at Excel pivot tables,  and    producing basic data visualizations (e. g. ,  line and bar charts).  You    will have analysed the results of an A/B test or taken the lead on your    company's analytics account.     You will have a proven and demonstrable track-record of integrating    data,  data analysis platforms,  and other products into a client-facing    capability.  The data analysis or machine learning is likely to be    pretty intense.     You will join an established consulting and cyber operations group as    lead data scientist.  It's equally important that you can perform    analysis,  touch production code,  visualize data,  etc.  Important skills    are expertise with tools designed for 'big data' and experience with    messy,  'real-life' datasets.     Key Responsibility Areas       Lead the design and operation of big data operations for both the        client and their customers       Deliver coherent architectures for expansible,  flexible and        defensible data solutions for clients       Advise,  analyse,  deliver reports and recommendations to critically        aware C-level Boards on data that supports cyber defensive        operations       Delivery of Projects to TCP (Time,  Cost,  Performance) envelopes       Lead teams of cyber defence operations personnel     Skills,  Qualifications & Knowledge    The following skills and experience are required    Basic Tools: you will be expected to know how to use the tools of the    trade.  This means a statistical programming language,  like R or Python,     and a database querying language like SQL.        Basic Statistics: you will need at least a basic understanding of        statistics is vital as a data scientist.  You should be familiar        with statistical tests,  distributions,  maximum likelihood        estimators,  etc.  This is also be the case for machine learning,  but        one of the more important aspects of your statistics knowledge will        be understanding when different techniques are or are not a valid        approach.  Our clients are data-driven companies where the product        and product stakeholders will depend on your help to make decisions        and design / evaluate cyber analysis.        Machine Learning: often working at a large company with huge        amounts of data,  or working at a company where the product itself        is especially data-driven,  you will need to be familiar with        machine learning methods.  This can mean things like k-nearest        neighbours,  random forests,  ensemble methods - all of the machine        learning buzzwords.  More important is to understand the        application,  really understanding when and how it is appropriate to        use different techniques.        Multivariable Calculus and Linear Algebra: you may be asked to        derive some of the machine learning or statistics results you        employed elsewhere in your new role.  You may be asked to lead on        some basic multivariable calculus or linear algebra questions,         since they form the basis of a lot of the data science techniques        and at a certain point,  it may become necessary for you to lead a        data science team to build out our own implementations in house for        our clients.  Understanding these concepts is most important at        clients where the product is defined by the data and small        improvements in predictive performance or algorithm optimization        can lead to huge wins for the company.        Data Munging: Frequently the data you analyse is going to be messy        and difficult to work with.  Because of this,  it's really important        to know how to deal with imperfections in data.  Some examples of        data imperfections include missing values,  inconsistent string        formatting and date formatting.  This will be most important at        clients where you lead an early data hire team,  or data-driven        clients where the product is not data-related (particularly because        the latter has often grown quickly with not much attention to data        cleanliness).        Data Visualization & Communication: visualizing and communicating        data is incredibly important,  especially for clients that are        making data-driven decisions for the first time or clients where        data scientists are viewed as people who help others make        data-driven decisions.  When it comes to communicating,  this means        describing your findings or the way techniques work to audiences,         both technical and non-technical and up to critically aware C-level        boards.  Visualization wise,  you should be familiar with data        visualization tools like ggplot and d3. js.  It is important to not        just be familiar with the tools necessary to visualize data,  but        also the principles behind visually encoding data and communicating        information.        Software Engineering: it is important to have a strong software        engineering background.  You'll be responsible for handling a lot of        data logging,  and potentially the development of data-driven        products.        Consultancy Skills: in addition you should have sound professional        consultancy skills,  good presentation skills; the ability to write        in concise,  accurate and clear English and exploit MS (Microsoft)        OA (Office Automation) tools.

Door nieuwe technologische ontwikkelingen blijft het een uitdaging om steeds nieuwe typen forensische sporen doorzoekbaar te maken of slimme analyses toe te voegen,  zoals entiteitextractie voor herkenning van kentekens,  IBAN-nummers of adressen.  Naast het dienen van een belangrijk maatschappelijk belang is Hansken ook een technisch zeer uitdagend project waar je telkens met nieuwe technieken in aanraking komt.  Bij dit R&amp;D-project wordt gewerkt volgens een agile ontwikkelproces,  met moderne ontwikkeltools die goed op elkaar aansluiten. Als forensisch software engineer big data ontwikkel je samen met een team van ongeveer 8 collega’s het platform Hansken verder om onder meer de performance,  schaalbaarheid en functionaliteit te verbeteren.  Aan het systeem worden hoge eisen aan de kwaliteit en betrouwbaarheid gesteld.  Daarom ben je kritisch over het functioneren ervan,  durf je vragen te stellen en sta je open voor feedback.  Naast je werk aan het systeem denk je mee over het continu verbeteren van het ontwikkelproces,  waarbij de forensische kennis zo goed mogelijk geborgd wordt.  Functie-eisenJe hebt een relevante hbo- of universitaire opleiding afgerond,  bijvoorbeeld (technische) informatica of software engineering. Je hebt meerdere jaren ervaring met Java en ten minste 1 andere programmeertaal. Je hebt ervaring met SCRUM,  Kanban of andere agile ontwikkelmethodieken. Ervaring met gedistribueerde omgevingen,  zoals Hadoop,  is een pre. Je bent proactief en communicatief vaardig. Je bent in staat om gestructureerd te werken en zo het overzicht te houden.

Over Nederlands Forensisch Instituut Wil jij weten waar je eventueel komt te werken? Lees dan snel verder over de organisatie en de afdeling .  De organisatie - Nederlands Forensisch Instituut Werken bij de Rijksoverheid betekent een bijdrage leveren aan een beter Nederland.  Dus ook aan een veilige en rechtvaardige samenleving voor iedereen.  Veiligheid en Justitie verdedigt en beschermt de rechtsorde.  Van beleid tot uitvoering.  Het Nederlands Forensisch Instituut (NFI) is een agentschap van het ministerie van Veiligheid en Justitie en levert kwalitatief hoogwaardige forensische diensten met behulp van state-of-the-art-technologie en wetenschap.  Gedreven NFI-professionals richten zich gezamenlijk op het tijdig leveren van begrijpelijke,  objectieve en zo nodig multidisciplinaire forensische analyses op meer dan dertig onderzoeksgebieden,  zoals DNA,  pathologie en toxicologie,  maar bijvoorbeeld ook digitale technologie en wapens.  De resultaten spelen een belangrijke rol bij opsporing,  vervolging en in rechtszaken.  In alle gevallen houdt het NFI zich bezig met zaken die direct van invloed zijn op het dagelijks leven.  Dat maakt werken voor het NFI zo bijzonder.  Want recht raakt mensen. Meer informatie over de organisatie De afdeling - Digitale Technologie en Biometrie De afdeling Digitale Technologie en Biometrie (DTB) houdt zich voornamelijk bezig met forensisch onderzoek binnen geautomatiseerde systemen.  Veel soorten software en hardware passeren hierbij de revue.  DTB werkt niet alleen voor de politie en het ministerie van Veiligheid en Justitie,  maar ook voor de Koninklijke Marechaussee,  de Fiscale en Sociale Inlichtingen- en Opsporingsdiensten,  de Algemene Inspectiedienst (AID) en de Nationale Politie,  waaronder de Landelijke Eenheid. Vaak hebben opdrachtgevers zelf gespecialiseerde deskundigen in dienst.  DTB verricht dan ook voornamelijk onderzoek in complexe gevallen waar de klanten zelf niet verder mee komen.  Ook krijgt DTB vaak (buitenlandse) rechtshulpverzoeken op digitaal gebied.  Vanwege de enorme technologische ontwikkelingen op dit terrein investeert DTB relatief veel tijd in onderzoek en ontwikkeling (R&amp;D) en kennisoverdracht. De afdeling werkt in innovatieve projecten nauw samen met diverse universiteiten en instituten,  zowel nationaal als internationaal.  De goede resultaten van die projecten dragen er mede aan bij dat het NFI op het gebied van digitale technologie internationaal zeer hoog staat aangeschreven.  De afdeling participeert in het FIDIS Network of Excellence.  Bij DTB werken ongeveer 100 medewerkers. www. nederlandsforensischinstituut. nlFunctiegroepDeze vacature valt in de functiegroep Wetenschappelijk Medewerker.  Binnen het Functiegebouw Rijk staat deze functiegroep omschreven als: uitvoeren en inhoudelijk verantwoordelijk zijn voor (complexere) wetenschappelijke onderzoeken. Wil je meer over de functiegroep Wetenschappelijk Medewerker en de betreffende doorgroeimogelijkheden te weten komen,  ga dan naar het Functiegebouw Rijk en kom alles te weten over Wetenschappelijk Medewerker . Wil je meer weten over het Functiegebouw Rijk? Bekijk dan de uitleg . Functiegroep RijkOm functies van medewerkers te beschrijven,  werkt het Rijk met functiegroepen.  Bijvoorbeeld de functiegroep beleidsmedewerker.  Voorheen hadden ministeries en grote diensten,  zoals de Belastingdienst en Rijkswaterstaat,  hun eigen functiebeschrijvingen.  Hierdoor waren functies moeilijk vergelijkbaar en hadden medewerkers weinig inzicht in welk soortgelijk werk binnen het Rijk aanwezig is en wat alternatieve loopbaanmogelijkheden zijn. De ruim 30. 000 functiebeschrijvingen zijn nu ingewisseld voor slechts 52 functiegroepen.  Er is één gemeenschappelijk taal ontstaan waardoor vergelijkbaarheid tussen functies nu wel mogelijk is en de verschillende loopbaanmogelijkheden binnen het Rijk zichtbaar worden.  Met de nieuwe resultaat- en ontwikkelgerichte functieprofielen worden medewerkers en leidinggevenden geholpen bij het maken van concrete werk- en ontwikkelafspraken. De 52 functieprofielen staan beschreven in de website Functiegebouw Rijk.  De website laat ook passende vacatures zien en de stappen die medewerkers in hun loopbaan kunnen maken.

Why is our Data Transformation team the next step for you?Based in the centre of the City and working from our stunning global head office,  Worldpay's Data Transformation team has put data at the centre of the business.  At the heart of this is our large Hadoop based Enterprise Data Platform that will be used to provide data insights both to our internal teams and our customers. How will you add value on a day-today basis?You will be a key member of the data transformation team working on our new data platform.  The Enterprise Data Platform is an innovative use of 'Big Data' technologies to provide powerful analytic capabilities for Worldpay.  A key task of this role is to load data from multiple operational systems into our Data Lake,  and to combine this data in ways that were not possible before.  Much of the data is highly structured while some has the flexible characteristics more typical of 'big data'.  Because of the large amount of structured data we use Hive QL (essentially SQL) as well as Hadoop's inbuilt data loading tools for much of the processing. This is a great opportunity to gain skills in the Hortonworks Data Platform and related tools in an innovative and passionate environment. What will make you the ideal candidate?Extensive knowledge of standard SQL (SQL-92) gained using large scale database systems such as Netezza,  DB2,  Sybase or Oracle is key to this role.  You will have experience of data loading,  either scripting or using ETL technologies,  in particular we would like to see evidence of development experience in an environment using strict source-code control and release procedures.  Existing hands on experience with Big Data technologies like Apache Hadoop,  MapReduce,  HDFS,  Hive,  Pig,  Sqoop and NoSQL databases,  Hbase and related standards and technologies is advantageous. You will have the ability and willingness to create and maintain concise,  accurate,  readable,  relevant documentation on our wiki (we use Confluence; knowledge of other source code control systems will be useful),  along with a good understanding of UNIX systems,  especially Linux and you will also have the ability to develop reliable,  maintainable,  efficient code in most of SQL,  Linux shell,  Java and Python. How is Worldpay changing the world?We are leaders in modern money.  Each and every time you use your debit card or credit card to pay for something,  whether online or face-to-face,  there's a good chance it happened because of us.  On an annual basis our innovations,  systems and technology enable billions of money transactions globally.  Working with customers large and small,  we help them to take your payments quickly,  safely and reliably,  allowing them to grow their businesses and making your life more convenient in the process.  As a leader in global fintech and the largest London IPO since 2011,  this is a great time to join us in building for the next phase of the Worldpay journey.

Wat leren we van de beschikbare historische data om de toekomst beter    te voorspellen? En als je kunt voorspellen,  wat zijn dan de “next best    actions”? Je vakmanschap en creativiteit leiden tot inzichten die je    visueel aantrekkelijk presenteert.  Je bent in staat om de meerwaarde    hiervan duidelijk te communiceren.  De mate waarin de analyses,     algoritmes en applicaties van jouw team en jezelf worden toegepast    binnen de organisatie bepaalt jouw succes.     Hoe ziet je werkdag eruit?

We verzamelen data,  die omgezet wordt in relevante informatie op basis    waarvan we adviseren.  Deze data wordt deels aangeleverd door werkgevers    (inkomensgegevens) maar ontstaat voor het grootste deel binnen APG: van    onze ca.  4. 5 miljoen deelnemers berekenen we aanspraak- en    uitkeringsbedragen,  we keren per jaar zo’n 9 miljard euro uit,  ons    callcenter verwerkt zo’n half miljoen telefoontjes op jaarbasis en de    websites van onze opdrachtgevende fondsen verwerken een veelvoud aan    bezoeken per jaar.     Je gaat deel uitmaken van een team met ongeveer 35 professionals,  van    wie 5 data scientists.     Alle teamleden zijn gericht op verandering en gedreven.  Er heerst een    mooie mix van een goede teamgeest met voldoende zelfstandigheid en    eigen verantwoordelijkheid.  Er is veel aandacht voor persoonlijke    opleiding en ontwikkeling.  De recent (mede door APG) opgerichte Campus    voor Business Intelligence en Smart Services zorgt voor een sterk    innovatie gerichte omgeving.

Wat we doen Veel consumenten zien door de bomen het bos niet meer in de energiemarkt,  of in bijvoorbeeld het aanbod van zonnepaneelsystemen.  Dat leidt er vaak toe dat ze geen actie ondernemen,  terwijl ze wel degelijk zouden kunnen profiteren van de voordelen die de markt hen biedt.   iChoosr heeft een manier ontwikkeld om consumenten te helpen door groepsaankopen te organiseren.  Dit werkt als volgt: samen met Community Leaders (voor consumenten vertrouwde organisaties zoals consumentenorganisaties,  gemeenten,  provincies,  kranten en politieke partijen) informeert en motiveert iChoosr consumenten om zich in te schrijven voor een groepsaankoop.  De interesse van deze groep consumenten in een aantrekkelijk aanbod wordt in een veiling aangeboden aan gekwalificeerde leveranciers.  Daaruit volgt een scherp aanbod van de winnende leverancier dat wordt aangeboden aan de deelnemers.  Elke deelnemer kan op dat moment besluiten om al dan niet gebruik te maken van dat winnende aanbod.  Deelnemers die daartoe beslissen,  worden vervolgens door iChoosr volledig ‘ontzorgd’ in het vervolgtraject (tijdens en nà het overstapproces).   Het groepsaankoop-model heeft inmiddels duidelijk aangetoond zeer aantrekkelijk te zijn voor alle betrokken stakeholders: Consumenten zijn beter in staat om gebruik te maken van een aantrekkelijk aanbod in de markt zonder zelf een heel selectieproces te hoeven doorlopen; Community leaders zijn enthousiast over de hoog gewaardeerde dienstverlening voor hun achterban; Leveranciers krijgen waardevolle,  goed geïnformeerde en potentieel loyale klanten.   Wat zijn je taken &amp; verantwoordelijkheden het (verder) ontwikkelen,  standaardiseren en efficiënter maken van dataprocessen,  waaronder het automatiseren en optimaliseren van regelmatig terugkerende rapportages en selecties/analyses; het bewerken van data,  zoals het verrijken en ontsluiten van data uit verschillende bronnen,  het opschonen en ontdubbelen van data; het efficiënt en effectief maken en uitvoeren van selecties van deelnemersgroepen voor emailcampagnes; het uitvoeren van analyses ten behoeve van de business; je begrijpt hoe onze business in elkaar zit en weet dit te vertalen in de analyses die je maakt.    Met wie je vooral te maken hebt Je werkt nauw samen met je collega’s van data analyse,  de marketing manager,  de online marketeer en de projectleiders die eindverantwoordelijk zijn voor het verloop en de resultaten van de groepsaankopen.  Je bent een aanspreekpunt voor de gehele organisatie op het gebied van data en rapportage en hebt daarmee een overkoepelende functie.   Wat we bieden iChoosr biedt een internationaal georiënteerd full-time dienstverband  in een informele werksfeer met enthousiaste en professionele collega’s die graag in teamverband resultaten behalen.  Als Data Analist heb je veel vrijheid om zelf invulling te geven aan de functie en kan je doorgroeien naar ruimere verantwoordelijkheden binnen iChoosr.  iChoosr is een open,  innovatieve,  continu lerende organisatie met veel vrijheid en ruimte voor eigen initiatief.  Er wordt hard gewerkt met plezier.  De werkzaamheden vinden plaats vanuit ons kantoor in het centrum van Amsterdam,  waarbij de andere Europese landen waar iChoosr actief is incidenteel bezocht worden.  Wij bieden marktconforme arbeidsvoorwaarden waaronder 25 vakantiedagen,  een laptop,  een GSM abonnement en een doorlopende pensioenbijdrage na één jaar dienstverband.    Wat vinden wij belangrijk dat onze nieuwe medewerker in huis heeft Een afgeronde academische opleiding,  bij voorkeur met een opleiding in marketing; Minimaal 2 – 3 jaar werkervaring; Strategische denker met hands-on mentaliteit; Uitstekend analytisch en cijfermatig inzicht en dit kunnen vertalen naar de business; Kennis en ervaring met data analyse,  bewerkingsmethoden en technieken (bijvoorbeeld SQL,  Excel,  Tableau); Je kan zelfstandig werken en bent resultaatgericht; Initiatiefrijk,  proactief,  inventief en flexibel; Je bent nieuwsgierig ingesteld en wilt continu verbeteren; Teamplayer met een flexibele werkinstelling waarbij snel actie wordt ondernomen als het werk dit vraagt; Goede mondelinge en schriftelijke communicatie in het Nederlands en Engels,  kennis van Frans en/of Duits is een pré; Je woont in Amsterdam of directe omgeving (&lt; 50 km).

The business will reinvent how consumers shop for auto insurance in the US,  creating a “Travelocity®” like process for those products.

Working on projects across our product portfolio and across different geographical entities,  new challenges await every day.  This person can utilize their own knowledge and our technology to drive profits in all parts of the group and make suggestions for changes to processes and procedures.  No one will ever say “No” to a good idea! The successful candidate will have an ability to align analytical capabilities to strategic priorities.

Corporate Overview Big data is fuelling the growth of many industries.  From financial firms to research labs and even for the individual user with a smart phone,  the amount to data we produce and access daily is growing exponentially.  The question of how to store and,  more pressingly,  how to move this vast amount of data is one that is currently a hot topic not just in data science but increasingly in physics,  biology and the business world.  The researchers at Penteract28 are developing the next generation of compression,  security and data transfer technologies.   Initially,  you will join a small team of physicists and mathematicians to work on our Information Density Holography (IDH) project.  This is a multi-stage compression technique that utilizes ideas drawn from the intersection of pure mathematics,  physics and data science.  Duties and Responsibilities The objective of our research is to develop new methods in data analysis and digital holography for the purposes of big data compression.  In particular,  we are investigating the concept of generalizing holographic imaging to allow for the creation of holograms of high-dimensional data objects.  To ensure the holographic process is efficient,  we employ advanced topological data analysis methods to classify and cluster the data sets.  The successful candidate will work with our digital holography and data analysis teams.  They will lend their expert knowledge to refine our current prototype and lead research efforts to investigate potential new directions in the storage,  transmission and security of big data.  Reporting to our Lead Mathematician,  you will conduct independent research and work closely with our algebraic topology,  physics,  electro-photonics and user interface teams.  A key aspect of the project involves collaboration with experimental groups and business partners.

You will make an outstanding contribution,  leading exciting and    important research on the distinctive ethical issues raised by the use    of big data across a range of disciplines,  and within both public    sector and commercial life: issues such as privacy,  confidentiality and    trust; benefit and the public interest; consent and abuse; security and    surveillance.  Through developing inter-disciplinary work with top    academics in the Leeds Institute for Data Analytics (LIDA),  and in    other relevant disciplines at Leeds,  you will be expected to enhance    the reputation of the University of Leeds as a major world centre for    the study of data analytics.     Leading work with colleagues in the LIDA/IDEA CETL steering group on    the ethics and governance of big data work,  and taking advantage of    existing links -- including household name retailers,  and public    organisations such as the police and health care providers --you will    develop a new impact case study.  You will bring the benefits of    well-grounded philosophical analysis to this major area of public    interest and potential public concern,  and thereby add still further to    the breadth and depth of the IDEA CETL’s research activity in applied    ethics.

You have specific tools and techniques you prefer but you love to investigate new modelling and clustering techniques as well.  Preferably,  you have experience building enterprise grade solutions,  but smart,  curious,  organized,  and passionate about the data modelling process are far more important.  You understand that your analysis is the backbone of our organization and the heart of our value,  our clients.  Our ability to perform rests squarely on your shoulders.   Can you explain it to your parents?  Our clients expect that we can interact with both their technology teams and senior management.  The Data Scientist we are looking for is not just someone who knows how to transform data and build models but knows how to talk about it as well; we call it “the parents” skill.  Can you explain it to your parents!? This is a critical.   Do you speak People?  Our mission is to bring insights to the full spectrum of challenges being addressed by Human Resource organizations today,  so naturally the data we collect is about People.  This makes experience with People data extremely valuable but not critical.  We can teach you this if you have a passion to learn.

Overview  McKinsey Solutions is seeking a Data Scientist to join the Organizational Solutions - People Insights team in Louvain-la-Nueve,  Belgium.  We are a new start-up,  embedded within the McKinsey Solutions portfolio of software and services,  and we are looking to expand our team of Data Scientists.  Detailed Description People Insights is an analytics solution provider geared towards just that – People Insights.  We leverage the latest in technology,  computer science,  mathematics and psychology,  to shed light on one the toughest challenges business leaders face today,  Talent Management.  Our focus is creating scalable and sustainable solutions that arm organizations with insights across all aspects of the talent management lifecycle.  Here is a short video about what we do: https://drive. google. com/file/d/0Bw49QVsqDSHlYmRzdmVpRjF4REE/view Are you a Data Scientist?  Data Scientists are creative problem solvers who love all things data.  They spend their spare time thinking of new ways to collect,  blend,  model,  and cluster dramatically different data types to find interesting and useful analysis.  New modelling challenges get them out of bed every morning.  For you it’s not just about the data itself,  but what the information means and represents.  You have specific tools and techniques you prefer but you love to investigate new modelling and clustering techniques as well.  Preferably,  you have experience building enterprise grade solutions,  but smart,  curious,  organized,  and passionate about the data modelling process are far more important.  You understand that your analysis is the backbone of our organization and the heart of our value,  our clients.  Our ability to perform rests squarely on your shoulders.   Can you explain it to your parents?  Our clients expect that we can interact with both their technology teams and senior management.  The Data Scientist we are looking for is not just someone who knows how to transform data and build models but knows how to talk about it as well; we call it “the parents” skill.  Can you explain it to your parents!? This is a critical.   Do you speak People?  Our mission is to bring insights to the full spectrum of challenges being addressed by Human Resource organizations today,  so naturally the data we collect is about People.  This makes experience with People data extremely valuable but not critical.  We can teach you this if you have a passion to learn.   McKinsey Solutions (MSO) is a fast-growing group within McKinsey that leverages 85 years of McKinsey industry and functional expertise with data,  proprietary analytics,  and software tools.  Having developed and deployed some 15 solutions to more than 400 companies over the last years,  MSO continues to grow and now numbers more than 700 full-time professionals.  You can see an overview of MSO here: http://www. mckinseysolutions. com Desired Skills What else are we looking for?  A history of honesty and integrity - For us,  client confidentiality is paramount.  Our clients trust us with some of their most valuable information and our ability to maintain this trust has allowed us to grow at an unprecedented pace.   Passion for travel and new places - We are headquartered in New York City but our leadership team is global.  Our clients are global as well.  Our team is global,  with the ability to travel when necessary.  Sometimes this can be demanding,  we know,  but we believe face-to-face always works best.   Drive to build something BIG – This is an opportunity to build something and you should want to be a part of it.  Turns out building is not a 9 to 5.  Very few innovative things are.   Serious when it counts - it is a business after all.   Genuinely someone we can hang out with - We have a great team with many different types of people,  from all different backgrounds.  We spend a lot of time together working and playing.  Those two aren’t mutually exclusive.  This bond is important to us because it is the essence of our culture.  Basic requirements include:  University degree,  ideally Masters or higher,  in statistics,  mathematics,  information systems,  social informatics,  measurement and metrics,  economic analysis,  or other disciplines for which quantitative methods are an important part  2 -3 years of experience  Experience in multivariate statistical procedures (multiple regression,  MANOVA,  factor analysis,  etc. ) and machine learning methods (Random Forest,  bootstrapping,  etc. ).

    Funded PhD Studentships in “Small Summaries for Big Data”    Funding Details: Fees and maintenance at RCUK Level    Length of Award: 4 years (PhD)    Supervisor: Professor Graham Cormode    Funded studentships are available in the area of computer science to    work on algorithms and data structures for summarization of massive    data sets.   Funding is provided through the prestigious ERC program,     under project 647557,  “Small Summaries for Big Data”.     Project Overview    A fundamental challenge in processing the massive quantities of    information generated by modern applications is in extracting suitable    representations of the data that can be stored,  manipulated and    interrogated on a single machine.  A promising approach is in the design    and analysis of compact summaries: data structures which capture key    features of the data,  and which can be created effectively over    distributed data sets.  Popular summary structures include the Bloom    filter,  which compactly represents a set of items,  and sketches which    allow vector norms and products to be estimated.     Such Structures Are Very Attractive,  Since They Can Be Computed In    Parallel And Combined To Yield a Single,  Compact Summary Of The Data.     Yet The Full Potential Of Summaries Is Far From Being Fully Realized.     Professor Cormode Is Recruiting a Team To Work On Important Problems    Around Creating Small Summaries For Big Data.  The Goal Is To    Substantially Advance The State Of The Art In Data Summarization,  To    The Point Where Accurate And Effective Summaries Are Available For a    Wide Array Of Problems,  And Can Be Used Seamlessly In Applications That    Process Big Data.  PhD Studentships Can Work On a Variety Of Topics    Related To The Project,  Including       The design and evaluation of new summaries for fundamental        computations such as large matrix computations       Summary techniques for complex structures such as massive graphs       Summaries that allow the verification of outsourced computation        over big data.        Application of summaries in the context of monitoring distributed,         evolving streams of data     The expectation is that this will lead to novel results in the    summarization of large volumes of data,  which will be published in    top-rated venues.     You will possess a degree in Computer Science,  mathematics or very    closely related discipline (or you will shortly be obtaining it).   You    should have good knowledge of one or more of the following areas:    algorithm design and analysis; randomized and approximation algorithms;    communication complexity and lower bounds; streaming or sublinear    algorithms.   The post is based in the Department of Computer Science at    the University of Warwick,  but collaborations with closely related    research organizations such as the centre for Discrete Mathematics and    its Applications (DIMAP),  the Warwick Institute for the Science of    Cities (WISC); and the newly formed Alan Turing Institute (ATI) will be    strongly encouraged.     For examples of relevant research and related topics,  please consult    Prof.  Cormode’s web pages at    http://www2. warwick. ac. uk/fac/sci/dcs/people/Graham_Cormode    Eligibility    Candidates should hold a degree in Computer Science,  Mathematics or    closely related discipline,  or expect to complete one before the    commencement of the studentship.   The degree should show a high level    of achievement (1st or 2. 1 level).     Funding Level    Funding is available to support stipend and fees at the UK/EU level for    4 years (this does not cover fees for non-EU students,  see    http://www2. warwick. ac. uk/study/postgraduate/funding/fees/ for more    information).     Application Details    Please send a CV to g. cormode@warwick. ac. uk giving details of your    education and achievements to date,  including details of performance in    relevant university-level subjects (such as Algorithms,  Data    Structures,  Complexity,  Mathematical analysis of algorithms,  linear    algebra and so on).   Please also include a covering note explaining how    your background and interests make you relevant to the aims of the    project.     Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis as they are received.     To ensure full consideration,  please aim to submit before one of two    main deadlines,  November 30th 2015,  and March 31st 2016.     This project has received funding from the European Research Council    (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation    programme (grant agreement No 647557).

Engineering excellence is at the heart of Williams’ DNA.  The team’s business model is unique in the pit-lane.  While many of the other teams are extensions of multinational companies’ marketing departments,  Williams is wholly independent; it exists solely to go racing.  Its commercial partnerships must drive value back to its partners’ companies. To meet these expectations,  the team has grown exponentially since 1977.  What started out as a group of 17 people has mushroomed into a company that now employs more than 600 people at its technology campus in Grove,  Oxfordshire. “This is the toughest era of F1 that I have been involved with, ” says Frank Williams.  “The standard of engineering in the pit-lane is very high indeed and for that reason we must always strive to do better.  The next race is the only thing that matters in F1”. We are currently seeking an experienced Data Analyst to join our Aerodynamic Test Facilities Team.  Reporting to the Head of Aerodynamic Test Facilities,  the key purpose of this role is to provide in depth analysis of the Aerodynamic Test Facility test techniques and systems performance. Key responsibilities will include proposing and progressing projects for the development of the department systems and operations ensuring that Williams F1 benefits from the use of the latest technologies and processes.  In addition,  the successful individual will play a lead role in liaising with the Aerodynamic Department and the Support Group on data quality issues,  proposing remedial actions where appropriate. With a strong working knowledge of statistical analysis tools,  together with some knowledge of VB,  C#,  C++ Python or any structured programming language and some exposure to SQL/querying databases,  the successful candidate will ideally have a wide knowledge and experience of advanced wind tunnel testing techniques.  Tenacious,  with an eye for detail,  the candidate will have the ability to manage large volumes of data whilst also being able to maintain an overall picture of activities.

     Please review the job details and click Apply.      Java Sale: Java Data Scientist gezocht voor fashion bedrijf in    Amsterdam! (Lijnden) Introduction    Ben jij al enkele jaren als Java ontwikkelaar werkzaam? Wil jij je    graag als developer verder ontwikkelen en meer dan alleen code kloppen?    Lijkt het jou leuk om als pionier een team op te zetten binnen een    grote Nederlandse fashion organisatie? Dan is dit een niet te missen    kans!    Organization    Onze klant is een bekende Nederlandse winkelketen van kledingwinkels    die zich op zowel mannen als vrouwen kleding richt.  Momenteel hebben ze    meer dan 80 filialen verspreid over Nederland,  Duitsland,  Engeland en    België.  Ook hun webshop bevat meer dan 1. 000 artikelen met kleding van    bekende merken als Army & Ivy,  Non Grada en Seven Sisters.     De afgelopen 30 jaar is het bedrijf uitgegroeid tot één van de grootste    winkelketens van Nederland en hebben ze meer dan 2. 400 medewerkers in    binnen- en buitenland.  Ze werken altijd met de nieuwste concepten in    zowel hun winkels,  webshop als bedrijfsvoering.  Dit innovatieve    karakter heeft het bedrijf gemaakt tot het succes wat het nu is.     Ondanks het internationale karakter van dit bedrijf wordt de    IT-afdeling in Amsterdam opgezet.  De afgelopen jaren hebben ze    development werkzaamheden geoutsourced.  Echter willen ze kennis van de    R&D afdeling graag in eigen beheer houden en als pioniers een    innoverende weg inslaan.  Dat is ook de reden dat ze hun eigen data    science team in Amsterdam hebben opgezet.  Lijkt het jou leuk om als    Data Scientist/ontwikkelaar deel uit te maken van een bloeiend en    dynamisch bedrijf binnen de fashion branche? Ben jij een harder werker    en wil jij hiervoor goed beloont worden? Dan zijn wij op zoek naar jou!    Function    Als Java ontwikkelaar/Data Scientist zul jij je steentje bijdragen aan    het e-commerce team.  Je zult je gaan bezig houden met vraagstukken als:    Hoeveel T-shirts gaan we volgend jaar verkopen? Welke invloed heeft het    weer op online én offline verkopen? Welke klantpatronen zien we? Hoe    kunnen de voorraden beter gealloceerd worden?    Als ontwikkelaar zul je nauw samenwerken met verschillende disciplines    binnen het bedrijf.  Je kunt hierbij denken aan: de marketingafdeling    (online,  offline social media),  PR en het data science team.  Samen met    je IT-collega’s zorg je ervoor dat de applicaties optimaal aansluiten    op de vragen en wensen vanuit de organisatie.  Je beperkt je hierin niet    alleen tot software development,  maar je zult je ook verdiepen op data    science vlak.  Je kunt hierbij denken aan analyses en patroonherkenning    waarbij je gebruik zult maken van verschillende state of the art    technologieën.     Binnen het bedrijf hangt er een hele informele,  open en laagdrempelige    sfeer.  Op de werkvloer is ruimte voor een grapje al wordt er natuurlijk    ook hard gewerkt.  De gemiddelde leeftijd binnen het e-commerce team is    rond de 28 jaar dus je moet je wel prettig voelen in een jonge en    dynamische omgeving.  Verder is er,  ondanks de omvang van de    organisatie,  totaal geen sprake van hiërarchie.  Je zult namelijk direct    schakelen met de directeur en het data science team waardoor je snel    stappen kunt maken.     Het development team waarin jij terecht komt is onderdeel van de    e-commerce tak van dit fashion bedrijf.  Het huidige IT-team bestaat uit    een senior Java ontwikkelaar en een data scientist.  Dit team is nu    ongeveer een jaar samen en willen ze graag verder uitbouwen.  Aangezien    dit een nieuw team is,  is dit in feite een kleine start-up binnen een    bestaande organisatie.  We zijn daarom op zoek naar een Java pionier die    het leuk vindt om samen met collega’s iets moois op te bouwen binnen    een bestaande organisatie met vrijwel onbegrensde mogelijkheden.     Oftewel: The best of both worlds!    Qua technologieën maak je veel gebruik van de standaard Java technology    stack: Spring,  Hibernate,  Maven etc.  Aantoonbare ervaring hierin is    heel belangrijk.  Daarnaast zul jij je bij dit bedrijf verdiepen in    innovatieve technologieën en talen waaronder: Scala,  Hadoop,  AngularJS,     Elasticsearch,  Spark,  Cassandra,  MongoDB,  Akka,  en zul jij je ook    verder verdiepen in Continious intergration en de delivery    vraagstukken.  Ervaring hierin is geen must,  maar je interesse moet hier    natuurlijk wel liggen.  Tijdens je werkzaamheden krijg je binnen het    team veel vrijheid in je technologie keuze waardoor je snel kunt    schakelen.  Het is belangrijk dat dit bij je past en jij je hier prettig    bij voelt.     Verder krijg je binnen de organisatie volop mogelijkheden om door te    groeien en jezelf te ontwikkelen.  Ze bieden verschillende mogelijkheden    om jouw kennis bij te spijkeren waarbij je kunt denken aan opleidingen,     certificeringen en seminars.  Daarnaast zijn de arbeidsvoorwaarden    uitstekend waaronder een zeer goed salaris,  30 vakantiedagen en    interessante secundaire arbeidsvoorwaarden.  Verder is er een flexibele    inlooptijd tussen 8 en half 10.  Kortom alles wat jij nodig hebt om    jezelf optimaal te ontwikkelen!    Heb jij al enkele jaren werkervaring,  maar wil jij meer dan puur code    kloppen? Werk jij graag in een jonge en dynamische omgeving waarin héél    veel mogelijk is? Ben jij een echte pionier en niet bang om je eigen    weg in te slaan? Solliciteer dan op deze vacature! Hoe? Lees snel    verder op de volgende pagina of neem vrijblijvend contact met ons op    via: 020 8203 666.     Requirements       Een afgeronde HBO/WO (technische) informatica opleiding;       Een pioniersinstinct en drive om zelf iets op poten te zetten;       Minimaal 3 jaar ervaring met Java en de standaard techology stack:        Spring,  hibernate,  Maven;       De eagerness om je te verdiepen in nieuwe technologieën als Scala,         Hadoop,  AngularJS,  Spark en Cassandra;       Analytisch en communicatief vaardig karakter;       Het leuk vinden om binnen een dynamische omgeving te schakelen met        verschillende disciplines;       Je hebt een goed idee van wat continious delivery en intergration        inhoudt en wat de mogelijkheden hierin zijn;       Ervaring met SCRUM is een pre.      Offer       Een zeer goed salaris dat afhankelijk is van kennis en ervaring;       Volop opleiding en certificering mogelijkheden;       38 urige werkweek;       Veel vrijheid in je werk op technologisch vlak;       Flexibele werktijden;       Je verdiepen in de nieuwste technologieën;       Goede pensioensregeling;       30 vakantiedagen;       Standplaats: Amsterdam;       Gelijk een jaar contract!

Python,  Celery,  Elasticsearch,  Solr,  MongoDB,  Casandra,  AngularJS,  CSS,  Vagrant,  . . . .  Still with us? Then keep on reading! We're looking for bright full stack engineers who are passionate about big data and machine learning.  If you would call yourself Data Overlord,  Distributed Processing Junky,  NoSQL Pudge,  λ-architecture zealot,  or the like,  then we may have a match! We are a no-nonsense company,  and spin-off from the University of Amsterdam.  Don't expect extravagant offices,  but all the more challenging problems,  bleeding-edge methods,  and in-depth discussions.    Who are we? 904Labs is an Amsterdam-based startup offering next-generation search and recommendation engines to large (inter)national eCommerce and publisher sites.  904Labs turns scientifically proven methods for onsite search and recommendation into efficient,  fully-functional SaaS solutions.  Forget about static search algorithms that have ruled the world for 40 years and help us in bringing bleeding-edge search technology to the world.  Our solutions are self learning,  using feedback signals from search engine users to optimize and personalize search results in real time.  Analytics give unprecedented insights in the search behavior of visitors and allows to identify search trends and support business decisions.  Our technology is unique in our domain and we keep ahead of the curve via collaborations with the University of Amsterdam and inhouse development.  We received special grants from the University of Amsterdam to accelerate breaking technologies and we're currently running pilots with large international and national companies,  with a few more pilots in the making.  We are still a small team,  but aiming to grow rapidly over the next few months.  Join us at the start of this journey!   Who are you? A clever engineer with proven experience in Python and the majority of the following: Celery,  Elasticsearch,  Solr,  MongoDB,  Casandra,  AngularJS,  CSS,  Vagrant.  Experience or affinity with machine learning methods is a bonus.  Ideally,  you have a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence,  Computer Science or a related field.  You're not afraid of working in a small team,  which also means that you can work independently in designing,  developing,  and deploying solutions.  Don't worry,  however,  there's always someone to bounce ideas back and forth.  You are creative.  Maybe not in terms of making up code,  but in coming up with solutions to problems that arise,  as well as in finding new and better ways to do things.  Part of your creativity is your eagerness to learn.  We're constantly improving our solutions and you like to keep up,  or even stay ahead,  as well! What do we offer? Responsibilities and a voice to which we'll listen:You're not simply yet-another-employee,  but rather one of the core members of the team.  Your opinions and input are an important aspect of our business.  You are looking for a position with some level of responsibility and importance.  Working with smart people in close cooperation: You're not alone.  We foster a team of smart people and we love to discuss problems and challenges,  both at a technical and conceptional level.  And when the office becomes too boring we move to more social venues for a drink.  Work that has impact: Our clients are large companies that sit on top of massive piles of interesting data and whose sites get truckloads of daily visitors.  Imagine serving hundreds of thousands of people with your solutions! Exploring next-generation technology: Many startups say that they're working on next-generation technology,  but 904Labs really does! ;-) New insights come straight from academia into our company and we need to make them actually work.  There's no such things as the "current product".  Room for own initiative: We love to work on new things,  even though they might not be directly related to our products.  We hope you share the same mindset.  So don't worry when you start coding a new fun pet project,  we're ok with it,  just let us be part of the fun as well! Flexibility: We're all in favor of flexibility.  You want to do 9-to-5,  that's fine,  but 10-to-6 is ok too.  We can even talk about 10pm to 6am.  We're open to discussing part-time employment and working remotely.  At the risk of sounding too fuzzy,  but a happy team member is good for the team.  Money: Yes,  we also offer money.

Hiervoor zal bijvoorbeeld ook bekeken    moeten worden welke tools op dit gebied al bestaan binnen de    organisatie.     Bij meer duidelijkheid zal hier uiteraard ook marktonderzoek voor    gedaan moeten worden.

We leverage the latest in technology,  computer science,  mathematics and psychology,  to shed light on one the toughest challenges business leaders face today,  Talent Management.  Our focus is creating scalable and sustainable solutions that arm organizations with insights across all aspects of the talent management lifecycle. Are you a Data Scientist?  Data Scientists are creative problem solvers who love all things data.  They spend their spare time thinking of new ways to collect,  blend,  model,  and cluster dramatically different data types to find interesting and useful analysis.  New modelling challenges get them out of bed every morning.  For you it’s not just about the data itself,  but what the information means and represents.  You have specific tools and techniques you prefer but you love to investigate new modelling and clustering techniques as well.  Preferably,  you have experience building enterprise grade solutions,  but smart,  curious,  organized,  and passionate about the data modelling process are far more important.  You understand that your analysis is the backbone of our organization and the heart of our value,  our clients.  Our ability to perform rests squarely on your shoulders.   Can you explain it to your parents?  Our clients expect that we can interact with both their technology teams and senior management.  The Data Scientist we are looking for is not just someone who knows how to transform data and build models but knows how to talk about it as well; we call it “the parents” skill.  Can you explain it to your parents!? This is a critical.   Do you speak People?  Our mission is to bring insights to the full spectrum of challenges being addressed by Human Resource organizations today,  so naturally the data we collect is about People.  This makes experience with People data extremely valuable but not critical.  We can teach you this if you have a passion to learn.

Drive to build something BIG – This is an opportunity to build something and you should want to be a part of it.  Turns out building is not a 9 to 5.  Very few innovative things are.   Serious when it counts - it is a business after all.   Genuinely someone we can hang out with - We have a great team with many different types of people,  from all different backgrounds.  We spend a lot of time together working and playing.  Those two aren’t mutually exclusive.  This bond is important to us because it is the essence of our culture.

The Data Scientist gathers intelligence from the massive streams of data that clients gather each day.  Due to the volume of data,  its multi-structured nature,  and the various advanced analysis involved,  MapReduce software available with,  for example,  Teradata Aster and Hadoop are used to supplement traditional SQL analysis.  Data can originate anywhere; from sales records,  web logs,  and web crawlers to jet engines,  electronic switches,  and countless other sources.  The Data Scientist sifts through the data for useful nuggets of information,  and then presents results to the client to allow business decisions to be made on the findings.

It’s 7am and the alarm goes off.  Some with a yawn,  some with attempts at the alarm clock to shut it off,  some hiding in their blankets,  some jumping right off the bed with a smile on their face,  kids everywhere start yet another day of discovery.  We all know the feeling of the minutes before the classroom: some will remember their kindergarten days,  some will barely remember with difficulty their last semester at university.  But most of us will have a clear memory of those professors who made a mark in our lives; and probably more than one chose a life path thanks to them.  A good professor is like a lighthouse,  a solid reference in a confused landscape,  a mentor,  someone who will talk to you from their experience,  who will listen and who will give you pointers on how to keep on going.  A good professor is essential because they can truly get us inspired by some specific subject.    You may have triggered by now memories of one or two key education professionals who,  back in the time,  felt really special to you.  Probably you can trace back that unique quality to things such as an ability to listen,  a passion to help pupils learn and a firm grip on the matter at hand.  Experience in the subject being discussed is of great value since it provides students with reference points,  allowing for exploration of the spaces between with a security net woven into the exploration itself.  Experience is the mother of wisdom,  they say,  and a good professor of mathematics is someone who loves mathematics and has been working with them for some time,  or a good professor of cooking has tasty cooking experience.    Just a couple more remarks on great educating powers,  and we’ll move on.  Promised.  First,  to teach is to learn.  Great teachers have a passion to discover new things,  to understand the world they live in,  to have a critical mindset that lets them uncover new areas or modes of relating to their environment.  Finally,  to teach is to communicate.

Tien jaar later werd de eerst stap naar het buitenland    gemaakt en sindsdien konden ook onze Duitse buren van de diensten van    dit bedrijf gebruik maken.

     Description    Data Scientist    I am looking for a number of Data Scientists to join this Cyber    Security consultancy.     Job Summary    The successful Data Scientist will supplement the Consulting and Cyber    Operations Business Unit.  You will be a proven operator within the    field,  and will ideally have both on-site client-facing advisory and    delivery roles as well as internal capability development roles.  A    consultancy role,  so travel will be an inherent part of the employment.     The Company    A systems and services integrator that specialises in cyber defence    operations.      Please note that due to the nature of the role you will need to    currently hold or be willing to undergo DV Clearance     Job Description    You will be excited by environments in which there is a large amount of    rapidly moving data and you will be keen to design and build the data    infrastructure that the company and clients will need going forward.     You will provide insightful analysis.  You will have held positions as    "Data Scientist" and "Data Engineer".  You will join an expanding area    of business,  so it is helpful that you're a statistics or machine    learning expert but important that you have a software engineering    background.  You will be confident and accomplished at mentoring junior    data scientists.     You will have a proven and demonstrable track-record of integrating    data,  data analysis platforms,  and other products into a client-facing    capability.  The data analysis or machine learning is likely to be    pretty intense.     You are likely to have a formal mathematics,  statistics,  or physics    background.  But it is important that you are able to focus more on    producing great data-driven products to answer operational questions    for the company and clients.  Our clients typically have massive amounts    of data and we offer a cyber-security capability portfolio for their    data-based service.     You will join an established consulting and cyber operations group as    data scientist.  It's equally important that you can perform analysis,     touch production code,  visualize data,  etc.  Important skills are    expertise with tools designed for 'big data' and experience with messy,     'real-life' datasets.     Skills,  Qualifications & Knowledge    The following skills and experience are required    Basic Tools: you will be expected to know how to use the tools of the    trade.  This means a statistical programming language,  like R or Python,     and a database querying language like SQL.     Basic Statistics: you will need at least a basic understanding of    statistics is vital as a data scientist.  You should be familiar with    statistical tests,  distributions,  maximum likelihood estimators,  etc.     This is also be the case for machine learning,  but one of the more    important aspects of your statistics knowledge will be understanding    when different techniques are or are not a valid approach.  Our clients    are data-driven companies where the product and product stakeholders    will depend on your help to make decisions and design / evaluate cyber    analysis.     Machine Learning: often working at a large company with huge amounts of    data,  or working at a company where the product itself is especially    data-driven,  you will need to be familiar with machine learning    methods.  This can mean things like k-nearest neighbours,  random    forests,  ensemble methods - all of the machine learning buzzwords.  More    important is to understand the application,  really understanding when    and how it is appropriate to use different techniques.     Multivariable Calculus and Linear Algebra: you may be asked to derive    some of the machine learning or statistics results you employed    elsewhere in your new role.  You may be asked to lead on some basic    multivariable calculus or linear algebra questions,  since they form the    basis of a lot of the data science techniques and at a certain point,     it may become necessary for you to lead a data science team to build    out our own implementations in house for our clients.  Understanding    these concepts is most important at clients where the product is    defined by the data and small improvements in predictive performance or    algorithm optimization can lead to huge wins for the company.     Data Munging: Frequently the data you analyse is going to be messy and    difficult to work with.  Because of this,  it's really important to know    how to deal with imperfections in data.  Some examples of data    imperfections include missing values,  inconsistent string formatting    and date formatting.  This will be most important at clients where you    lead an early data hire team,  or data-driven clients where the product    is not data-related (particularly because the latter has often grown    quickly with not much attention to data cleanliness).     Data Visualization & Communication: visualizing and communicating data    is incredibly important,  especially for clients that are making    data-driven decisions for the first time or clients where data    scientists are viewed as people who help others make data-driven    decisions.  When it comes to communicating,  this means describing your    findings or the way techniques work to audiences,  both technical and    non-technical and up to critically aware C-level boards.  Visualization    wise,  you should be familiar with data visualization tools like ggplot    and d3. js.  It is important to not just be familiar with the tools    necessary to visualize data,  but also the principles behind visually    encoding data and communicating information.     Software Engineering: it is important to have a strong software    engineering background.  You'll be responsible for handling a lot of    data logging,  and potentially the development of data-driven products.     Thinking Like A Data Scientist: our clients will want to see that    you're an analytically-minded data-driven problem solver.  At some point    you will probably be asked about some high level problem - for example,     about a test a client may want to run or a data-driven product it may    want to develop.
