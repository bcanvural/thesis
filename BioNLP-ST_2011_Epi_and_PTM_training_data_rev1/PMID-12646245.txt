Overexpression of the CT GalNAc transferase inhibits muscular dystrophy in a cleavage-resistant dystroglycan mutant mouse. 
Transgenic mice that express dystroglycan containing a serine to alanine point mutation at the normal site of cleavage (DG(S654A)) in their skeletal muscles fail to express endogenously cleaved dystroglycan and have muscular dystrophy [Neuromusc. Disord., in press]. Dystrophic DG(S654A) muscles have reduced binding of antibodies, including VIA4-1, that recognize carbohydrate antigens on alpha dystroglycan, a finding similar to muscles in some forms of congenital muscular dystrophy. Here we describe one DG(S654A) transgenic line where VIA4-1 antibody binding is absent in skeletal muscle. In theory, the absence of this carbohydrate antigen should inhibit later glycosylation events that would occur on the structure or structures this antibody binds to. One such modification is likely to be the CT carbohydrate antigen, which is present on alpha dystroglycan in muscles overexpressing the CT GalNAc transferase [Dev. Biol. 242 (2002) 58]. To test the relationship between the VIA4-1 and CT carbohydrate antigens, we made DG(S654A)/CT GalNAc transferase (DG(S654A)/CT) transgenic mice. Surprisingly, dystroglycan was cleaved, and alpha dystroglycan was glycosylated with the VIA4-1 antigen, in DG(S654A)/CT muscles. In addition, muscles in DG(S654A)/CT transgenic mice had little or no evidence of muscular dystrophy when compared to DG(S654A) littermates. These experiments demonstrate that the CT GalNAc transferase can affect the post-translational processing of dystroglycan and the extent of muscular dystrophy even in muscles where the VIA4-1 antigen is not present.
