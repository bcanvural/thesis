A high-throughput screen measuring ubiquitination of p53 by human mdm2. 
Tumor suppressor p53 is typically maintained at low levels in normal cells. In response to cellular stresses, such as DNA damage, p53 is stabilized and can stimulate responses leading to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. Corresponding to its central role in preventing propagation of damaged cells, mutation or deletion of p53 is found in nearly 50% of all human tumors. Mdm2 (mouse-d-minute 2) and its human ortholog (hmdm2 or hdm2) catalyze the ubiquitination of p53, targeting it for degradation via the proteosome. Thus, the activity of mdm2 is inversely correlated with p53 levels. Based on this, inhibition of human mdm2 activity by a small-molecule therapeutic will lead to net stabilization of p53 and be the basis for development of a novel cancer therapeutic. Previous high-throughput screening assays of mdm2 measured the autoubiquitination activity of mdm2, which occurs in the absence of an acceptor substrate such as p53. The major drawback to this approach is that inhibitors of mdm2 autoubiquitination may lead to a net stabilization of mdm2 and thus have the opposite effect of inhibitors that interfere with p53 ubiquitination. The authors describe the development, validation, and execution of a high-throughput screening measuring the ubiquitination of p53 by mdm2, with p53 labeled with europium and the other substrate (Ub-UbcH5b) labeled with a Cy5 on the ubiquitin. After confirming that known inhibitors are detected with this assay, it was successfully automated and used to query >600,000 compounds from the GlaxoSmithKline collection for mdm2 inhibitors.
