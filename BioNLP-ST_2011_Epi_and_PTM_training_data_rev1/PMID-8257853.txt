Glycosylation of the thrombin-like serine protease ancrod from Agkistrodon rhodostoma venom.  Oligosaccharide substitution pattern at each N-glycosylation site. 
In a previous study, we determined the structures of the glycans present in ancrod, a thrombin-like serine protease from the venom of the Malayan pit viper Agkistrodon rhodostoma (Pfeiffer et al. (1992) Eur J Biochem 205:961-78). In order to allocate the various carbohydrate chains to distinct N-glycosylation sites of the molecule, we have now isolated individual glycopeptides. Peptide moieties were identified after deglycosylation with peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl)asparagine amidase F by amino acid analysis and sequencing. Liberated oligosaccharides were assigned to the previously deduced carbohydrate structures by high performance liquid chromatography. Although only quantitative differences were observed, the results indicate that each glycosylation site of ancrod carries its characteristic oligosaccharide pattern. Furthermore, all potential sites were shown to be substituted by carbohydrates.
