Real-time imaging of histone H4 hyperacetylation in living cells. 
To visualize histone acetylation in living cells, we developed a genetically encoded fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based indicator. Response of the indicator reflects changes in the acetylation state of both K5 and K8 in histone H4. Using this acetylation indicator, we were able to monitor the dynamic fluctuation of histone H4 acetylation levels during mitosis, as well as acetylation changes in response to structurally distinct histone deacetylase inhibitors.
