Cortical cytoskeleton of giant moth eggs. 
Unfertilized eggs of several species of giant moths contain a substantial cortical cytoskeleton. This structure is assembled during oogenesis, and contains actin as a major fibrillar component. The presence of actin was confirmed by gel electrophoresis and binding to phalloidin, DNase I, and a monoclonal antibody against cytoskeletal actin. Several lines of evidence suggest that the fat body is a source of the actin in the oocyte and that the transport and acquisition of actin by the ovary are similar to the mechanism of vitellogenin acquisition. A possible role for the cortical cytoskeleton in directing early embryogenesis is discussed.
