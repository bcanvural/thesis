Aberrant methylation of DAP-kinase in therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes. 
Death-associated protein kinase (DAP-kinase), a proapoptotic serine/threonine kinase, is a candidate tumor suppressor gene. We studied the methylation status of DAP-kinase of 194 bone marrow samples from 160 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 34 with a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) at the time of initial diagnosis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Hypermethylation of DAP-kinase was present in 27.5% (44 of 160) of AML and in 47% (16 of 34) of MDS specimens and significantly correlated to loss of DAP-kinase expression (P =.008). It was significantly more frequent in AML secondary to therapy for other malignancies (s-AML; 14 of 29, 48.3%), as compared to de novo AML (30 of 131, 22.9%, P =.01). DAP-kinase hypermethylation in AML was associated with myelodysplastic changes in the bone marrow at the time of the initial diagnosis (P =.002) and with the presence of cytogenetic abnormalities (P =.02). Alteration in the apoptotic response due to the loss of DAP-kinase function may be an early event in the transformation pathway to secondary leukemia via myelodysplasia.
