Glycosylation of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein in relation to duration of disease in acute and chronic infection and inflammation. 
Microheterogeneity of acute phase proteins frequently differs in acute and chronic types of inflammation. However, it is unknown whether these changes depend on the duration of the inflammation in a given disease. We therefore investigated the microheterogeneity of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) in sera from patients with acute and chronic bacterial infection in comparison to rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. In acute bacterial infection Con A-reactivity of AGP was significantly elevated. By contrast, AGP in chronic bacterial infection showed the same glycosylation pattern as rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis being characterized by a decreased reactivity to Con A. Serial measurements in individual patients with bacterial infections showed a transition from the initially elevated to decreased reactivity to Con A as the disease became chronic.
