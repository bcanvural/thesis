Monohydroxylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons inhibit both osteoclastic and osteoblastic activities in teleost scales. 
AIMS: We previously demonstrated that monohydroxylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (OHPAHs) bound to a human estrogen receptor (ER) by a yeast two-hybrid assay, but polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons did not have a binding activity. Therefore, the direct effect of 3-hydroxybenz[a]anthracene (3-OHBaA) and 4-hydroxybenz[a]anthracene (4-OHBaA) on osteoclasts and osteoblasts in teleosts was examined. As a negative control, 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHPy), which has no binding activity to human ER, was used. MAIN METHODS: The effect of OHPAHs on osteoclasts and osteoblasts was examined by an assay system using teleost scale as each marker: tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase for osteoclasts and alkaline phosphatase for osteoblasts. Changes in cathepsin K (an osteoclastic marker) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) (an osteoblastic marker) mRNA expressions in 4-OHBaA-treated goldfish scales were examined by using a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. KEY FINDINGS: In both goldfish (a freshwater teleost) and wrasse (a marine teleost), the osteoclastic activity in the scales was significantly suppressed by 3-OHBaA and 4-OHBaA, although 1-OHPy did not affect the osteoclastic activity. In reference to osteoblasts, the osteoblastic activity decreased with both 3-OHBaA and 4-OHBaA and did not change with the 1-OHPy treatment. However, 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) significantly increased both the osteoclastic and osteoblastic activities in the scales of both goldfish and wrasse. The mRNA expressions of both cathepsin K and IGF-I decreased in the 4-OHBaA-treated scales but increased in the E(2)-treated scales. SIGNIFICANCE: The current data are the first to demonstrate that 3-OHBaA and 4-OHBaA inhibited both osteoclasts and osteoblasts and disrupted the bone metabolism in teleosts.
