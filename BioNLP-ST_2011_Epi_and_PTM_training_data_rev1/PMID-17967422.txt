CSF-1 and TPA stimulate independent pathways leading to lysosomal degradation or regulated intramembrane proteolysis of the CSF-1 receptor. 
The CSF-1 receptor is a protein-tyrosine kinase that has been shown to undergo regulated intramembrane proteolysis, or RIPping. Here, we have compared receptor downregulation and RIPping in response to CSF-1 and TPA. Our studies show that CSF-1 is a relatively poor inducer of RIPping and that CSF-1-induced receptor downregulation is largely independent of RIPping. TPA is a strong inducer of RIPping and TPA-induced receptor downregulation is mediated by RIPping. We further found that RIPping is dependent on TACE or a TACE-like protease, that CSF-1 and TPA use independent pathways to initiate RIPping, and that the intracellular domain is targeted for degradation through ubiquitination.
