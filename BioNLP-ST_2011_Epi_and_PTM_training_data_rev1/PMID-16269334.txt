The proteasome regulatory particle alters the SAGA coactivator to enhance its interactions with transcriptional activators. 
Promoter recruitment of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae SAGA histone acetyltransferase complex is required for RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription of several genes. SAGA is targeted to promoters through interactions with sequence-specific DNA binding transcriptional activators and facilitates preinitiation-complex assembly and transcription. Here, we show that the 19S proteasome regulatory particle (19S RP) alters SAGA to stimulate its interaction with transcriptional activators. The ATPase components of the 19S RP are required for stimulation of SAGA/activator interactions and enhance SAGA recruitment to promoters. Proteasomal ATPases genetically interact with SAGA, and their inhibition reduces global histone H3 acetylation levels and SAGA recruitment to target promoters in vivo. These results indicate that the 19S RP modulates SAGA complex using its ATPase components, thereby facilitating subsequent transcription events at promoters.
