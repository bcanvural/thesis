HIF-1alpha binding to VHL is regulated by stimulus-sensitive proline hydroxylation. 
Hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) is a global transcriptional regulator of the hypoxic response. Under normoxic conditions, HIF-1alpha is recognized by the von Hippel-Lindau tumor-suppressor protein (VHL), a component of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This interaction thereby promotes the rapid degradation of HIF-1alpha. Under hypoxic conditions, HIF-1alpha is stabilized. We have previously shown that VHL binds in a hypoxia-sensitive manner to a 27-aa segment of HIF-1alpha, and that this regulation depends on a posttranslational modification of HIF-1alpha. Through a combination of in vivo coimmunoprecipitation assays using VHL and a panel of point mutants of HIF-1alpha in this region, as well as MS and in vitro binding assays, we now provide evidence that this modification, which occurs under normoxic conditions, is hydroxylation of Pro-564 of HIF-1alpha. The data furthermore show that this proline hydroxylation is the primary regulator of VHL binding.
