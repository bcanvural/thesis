The catalytic mechanism of the hydroxylation reaction of peptidyl proline and lysine does not require protein disulphide-isomerase activity. 
Prolyl 4-hydroxylase, an alpha 2 beta 2 tetramer, catalyses the formation of 4-hydroxyproline in collagens. The beta subunit is known to be identical with the enzyme protein disulphide-isomerase and to possess disulphide-isomerase activity even when present in the prolyl 4-hydroxylase tetramer. We here report that lysyl hydroxylase, a homodimer, and algal prolyl 4-hydroxylase, a monomer, do not contain detectable protein disulphide-isomerase activity. Since the hydroxylase reaction mechanisms are similar, the data suggest that the protein disulphide-isomerase activity of the vertebrate prolyl 4-hydroxylase beta subunit is unlikely to be involved in the catalytic mechanism of the hydroxylation reaction.
