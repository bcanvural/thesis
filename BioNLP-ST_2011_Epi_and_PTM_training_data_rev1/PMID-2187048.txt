Gonadotrophin glycosylation and function. 
This review emphasizes the heterogeneous structure of the gonadotrophin hormones and the influence of different oligosaccharide structures on the bioactivity of these hormones. A summary has been made of the changes in biopotency of the gonadotrophins throughout the life-cycle of the human and in different endocrine states in the rat. In general it appears that the charge of the gonadotrophin conferred by the acid radicals attached to the terminal groups on the oligosaccharide structures strongly influences biopotency. Basic structures have a greater potency in in-vitro assays, but a short half-life in the circulation, while acidic isoforms are less potent, but have a longer circulatory time and are thus more active in in-vivo estimations. More basic forms are secreted over the adult reproductive years compared with the prepubertal period and old age. The glycosyl structure of the carbohydrate groups also alters in different endocrine states and is probably also important for the bioactivity and potency of the hormone. Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and gonadal steroids can influence the type of isoform synthesized and released, and therefore affect the function of gonadotrophins. GnRH enhances glycosylation, sulphation and biopotency. Oestradiol potentiates the glycosylation induced by GnRH and reduces sialylation, while testosterone increases sialylation.
