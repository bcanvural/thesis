Regulatory adaptation of isoprenoid biosynthesis and the LDL receptor pathway in fibroblasts from patients with mevalonate kinase deficiency. 
In a search for the pathophysiologic mechanisms, we estimated isoprenoid synthesis and concentration, cellular growth, and the activity of the LDL receptor pathway in fibroblasts from patients with mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD), a severe multisystemic disorder of cholesterol and non-sterol isoprenoid biosynthesis. In response to different concentrations of LDL and non-lipoprotein-bound cholesterol, MKD cells partially counteracted their enzyme defect by increased activities of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase (results from earlier studies) and the LDL receptor pathway, responses similar to the pharmacologic effects seen upon administration of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Rates of N-linked protein glycosylation, estimated as the amount of [14C]galactose-labeled macromolecules secreted into cell culture medium, were significantly decreased in MKD fibroblasts in comparison with control cells which may indicate alterations in the dolichol or dolichol phosphate pool. In response to exogenous cholesterol, the major feedback inhibitor of isoprenoid biosynthesis, growth velocities of MKD fibroblasts declined in comparison with control cells, further suggesting an impairment of non-sterol isoprenoid biosynthesis in MKD. Our results suggest an imbalance in the multilevel regulation of the biosynthesis of cholesterol and non-sterol isoprenoids in MKD, representing an additional causative factor responsible for the pre- and postnatal pathology of MKD.
