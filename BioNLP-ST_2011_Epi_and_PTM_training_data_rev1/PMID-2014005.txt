Molecular characterization of the O-acetyl transferase gene of converting bacteriophage SF6 that adds group antigen 6 to Shigella flexneri. 
Bacteriophage SF6 antigenically converts Shigella flexneri serotype Y strains (-;3,4) to type 3b carrying group antigen 6,3,4 by means of an O-acetylation of the O-antigenic polysaccharide chain. The gene for O-acetyl transferase of bacteriophage SF6 has been cloned, identified and sequenced. The predicted O-acetyl transferase protein encoded by this gene was found to consist of 333 amino acids, (37,185 daltons) and to have some similarity with the galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase protein of Escherichia coli. The gene has been shown to function in a live vaccine strain of S. flexneri Y type (delta aroD), making it a 3b type. The converted type 3b strain, SFL1104, was found to elicit significant protection against challenge by both wild-type serotypes 3b and Y in a guinea-pig keratoconjunctivitis model.
