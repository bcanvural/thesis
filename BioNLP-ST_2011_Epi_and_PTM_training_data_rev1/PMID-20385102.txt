Molting-specific downregulation of C. elegans body-wall muscle attachment sites: the role of RNF-5 E3 ligase. 
Repeated molting of the cuticula is an integral part of arthropod and nematode development. Shedding of the old cuticle takes place on the surface of hypodermal cells, which are also responsible for secretion and synthesis of a new cuticle. Here, we use the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to show that muscle cells, laying beneath and mechanically linked to the hypodermis, play an important role during molting. We followed the molecular composition and distribution of integrin mediated adhesion structures called dense bodies (DB), which indirectly connect muscles to the hypodermis. We found the concentration of two DB proteins (PAT-3/beta-integrin and UNC-95) to decrease during the quiescent phase of molting, concomitant with an apparent increase in lateral movement of the DB. We show that levels of the E3-ligase RNF-5 increase specifically during molting, and that RNF-5 acts to ubiquitinate the DB protein UNC-95. Persistent high levels of RNF-5 driven by a heatshock or unc-95 promoter lead to failure of ecdysis, and in non-molting worms to a progressive detachment of the cuticle from the hypodermis. These observations indicate that increased DB dynamics characterizes the lethargus phase of molting in parallel to decreased levels of DB components and that temporal expression of RNF-5 contributes to an efficient molting process.
