Glycosylation of high-affinity thrombin receptors appears necessary for thrombin binding. 
Monosaccharide binding competition, lectin affinity chromatography, and glycosylation inhibitors have been used to determine if glycosylation plays a role in thrombin-receptor interactions. Mannose appeared to specifically inhibit thrombin binding to mouse embryo (ME) and hamster fibroblasts. Concanavalin A bound to antibody-purified receptor fractions, and was used as an affinity ligand to purify receptor fractions that retained thrombin binding activity. Cells treated with tunicamycin (6.25 ng/ml) for 24 h lost approximately 35% of their high-affinity thrombin binding sites, yet binding of receptor monoclonal antibody TR-9 was not affected, indicating that the receptor was present in the membrane, but unable to bind thrombin. Thus thrombin receptor glycosylation may be directly involved in thrombin binding.
