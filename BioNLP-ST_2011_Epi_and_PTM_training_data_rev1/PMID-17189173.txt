Glycosylation variant analysis of recombinant human tissue plasminogen activator produced in urea-cycle-enzyme-expressing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line. 
Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) was produced in ornithine transcarbamoylase (OTC) cells by introducing the tPA gene into OTC cells. OTC cells were originally derived from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and express the first two enzymes of the urea cycle, carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (CPS I) and OTC. To investigate glycosylation variants, tPA variants produced in serum-supplemented culture medium of OTC-tPA cells were separated by lysine-Sepharose 4B chromatography. Unlike in previous studies that used lysine-Sepharose chromatography, two peaks were identified to correspond to eluted glycosylation variants type I and II and type II and the percentages of the type I and type II variants were found to be 23% and 77%, respectively. The biological activities of the type I and II and type II variants were twofold that of the Third International tPA Standard (98/714) produced in the CHO cell line, and the activity of type II variant was 12.6% higher than that of the type I and II variants. These results demonstrate that tPA produced in urea-cycle-enzyme-producing OTC cells have a very high biological activity and the percentage of type II variant which is very valuable for the biopharmaceutical industry is higher than that of any report using CHO cells.
