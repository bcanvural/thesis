Distinct dynamics and distribution of histone methyl-lysine derivatives in mouse development. 
Histone methylation acts as an epigenetic regulator of chromatin activity through the modification of arginine and lysine residues on histones H3 and H4. In the case of lysine, this includes the formation of mono-, di-, or trimethyl groups, each of which is presumed to represent a distinct functional state at the cellular level. To examine the potential developmental roles of these modifications, we determined the global patterns of lysine methylation involving K9 on histone H3 and K20 on histone H4 in midgestation mouse embryos. For each lysine target site, we observed distinct subnuclear distributions of the mono- and trimethyl versions in 10T1/2 cells that were conserved within primary cultures and within the 3D-tissue architecture of the embryo. Interestingly, three of these modifications, histone H3 trimethyl K9, histone H4 monomethyl K20, and histone H4 trimethyl K20 exhibited marked differences in their distribution within the neuroepithelium. Specifically, both histone H3 trimethyl K9 and H4 monomethyl K20 were elevated in proliferating cells of the neural tube, which in the case of the K9 modification was limited to mitotic cells on the luminal surface. In contrast, histone H4 trimethyl K20 was progressively lost from these medial regions and became enriched in differentiating neurons in the ventrolateral neural tube. The inverse relationship of histone H4 K20 methyl derivatives is even more striking during skeletal and cardiac myogenesis where the accumulation of the trimethyl modification in pericentromeric heterochromatin suggests a role in gene silencing in postmitotic muscle cells. Importantly, our results establish that histone lysine methylation occurs in a highly dynamic manner that is consistent with their function in an epigenetic program for cell division and differentiation.
