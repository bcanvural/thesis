CD34 molecule epitope distribution on cells of haematopoietic origin. 
The CD34 molecule belongs to the mucin membrane molecule family and is expressed on virtually all normal haematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC). Due to its heavy glycosylation, several different epitopes exist on the molecule. Based on the sensitivity of the glycosylated molecule to degradation with a glycoprotease from Pasteurella haemolytica and neuraminidase, three classes of epitopes have been identified. The class I and II epitopes are probably related to the glycosylated part of the molecule while class III epitopes are core protein related. It has been known for some time that CD34 class I epitopes are absent on CD34 molecules expressed on high endothelial venules. Here we review recent observations that expression of both class I and II epitopes, but not class III epitopes, is impaired on mature myeloid CD34-pos. HPC while no diverse class epitope expression was observed on immature HPC. In addition, cells from patients with CD34-pos. acute myeloid leukaemia of FAB classification M4-M5, i.e., leukaemic blast cells of relatively mature morphologic phenotype, also express less class I and II epitopes than class III epitopes. It therefore seems that HPC maturation and class I and II epitope deprivation are concomitant events and that CD34 class I and II epitopes are lost prior to downregulation of the CD34 molecule per se. The biological significance of this observation is discussed as well as the need to carefully select CD34-specific monoclonal antibodies for research and clinical purposes.
