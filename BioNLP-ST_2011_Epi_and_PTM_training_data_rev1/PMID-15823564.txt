In vitro differentiation of human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells into hepatocyte-like cells. 
In addition to long-term self-renewal capability, human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) possess versatile differentiation potential ranging from mesenchyme-related multipotency to neuroectodermal and endodermal competency. Of particular concern is hepatogenic potential that can be used for liver-directed stem cell therapy and transplantation. In this study, we have investigated whether human umbilical cord blood (UCB)-derived MSCs are also able to differentiate into hepatocyte-like cells. MSCs isolated from UCB were cultured under the pro-hepatogenic condition similar to that for bone marrow (BM)-derived MSCs. Expression of a variety of hepatic lineage markers was analyzed by flow cytometry, RT-PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence. The functionality of differentiated cells was assessed by their ability to incorporate DiI-acetylated low-density lipoprotein (DiI-Ac-LDL). As the cells were morphologically transformed into hepatocyte-like cells, they expressed Thy-1, c-Kit, and Flt-3 at the cell surface, as well as albumin, alpha-fetoprotein, and cytokeratin-18 and 19 in the interior. Moreover, about a half of the cells were found to acquire the capability to transport DiI-Ac-LDL. Based on these observations, and taking into account immense advantages of UCB over other stem cell sources, we conclude that UCB-derived MSCs retain hepatogenic potential suitable for cell therapy and transplantation against intractable liver diseases.
