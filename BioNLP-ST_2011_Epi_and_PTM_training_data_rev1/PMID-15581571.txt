4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase. 
4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) is an Fe(II)-dependent, non-heme oxygenase that catalyzes the conversion of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate to homogentisate. This reaction involves decarboxylation, substituent migration and aromatic oxygenation in a single catalytic cycle. HPPD is a member of the alpha-keto acid dependent oxygenases that typically require an alpha-keto acid (almost exclusively alpha-ketoglutarate) and molecular oxygen to either oxygenate or oxidize a third molecule. As an exception in this class of enzymes HPPD has only two substrates, does not use alpha-ketoglutarate, and incorporates both atoms of dioxygen into the aromatic product, homogentisate. The tertiary structure of the enzyme would suggest that its mechanism converged with that of other alpha-keto acid enzymes from an extradiol dioxygenase progenitor. The transformation catalyzed by HPPD has both agricultural and therapeutic significance. HPPD catalyzes the second step in the pathway for the catabolism of tyrosine, that is common to essentially all aerobic forms of life. In plants this pathway has an anabolic branch from homogentisate that forms essential isoprenoid redox cofactors such as plastoquinone and tocopherol. Naturally occurring multi-ketone molecules act as allelopathic agents by inhibiting HPPD and preventing the production of homogentisate and hence required redox cofactors. This has been the basis for the development of a range of very effective herbicides that are currently used commercially. In humans, deficiencies of specific enzymes of the tyrosine catabolism pathway give rise to a number of severe metabolic disorders. Interestingly, HPPD inhibitor/herbicide molecules act also as therapeutic agents for a number of debilitating and lethal inborn defects in tyrosine catabolism by preventing the accumulation of toxic metabolites.
