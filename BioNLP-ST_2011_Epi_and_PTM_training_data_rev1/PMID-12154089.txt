Postsynthetic trimethylation of histone H4 at lysine 20 in mammalian tissues is associated with aging. 
Methylation of the N-terminal region of histones was first described more than 35 years ago, but its biological significance has remained unclear. Proposed functions range from transcriptional regulation to the higher order packing of chromatin in progress of mitotic condensation. Primarily because of the recent discovery of the SET domain-depending H3-specific histone methyltransferases SUV39H1 and Suv39h1, which selectively methylate lysine 9 of the H3 N terminus, this posttranslational modification has regained scientific interest. In the past, investigations concerning the biological significance of histone methylation were largely limited because of a lack of simple and sensitive analytical procedures for detecting this modification. The present work investigated the methylation pattern of histone H4 both in different mammalian organs of various ages and in cell lines by applying mass spectrometric analysis and a newly developed hydrophilic-interaction liquid chromatographic method enabling the simultaneous separation of methylated and acetylated forms, which obviates the need to work with radioactive materials. In rat kidney and liver the dimethylated lysine 20 was found to be the main methylation product, whereas the monomethyl derivative was present in much smaller amounts. In addition, for the first time a trimethylated form of lysine 20 of H4 was found in mammalian tissue. A significant increase in this trimethylated histone H4 was detected in organs of animals older than 30 days, whereas the amounts of mono- and dimethylated forms did not essentially change in organs from young (10 days old) or old animals (30 and 450 days old). Trimethylated H4 was also detected in transformed cells; although it was present in only trace amounts in logarithmically growing cells, we found an increase in trimethylated lysine 20 in cells in the stationary phase.
