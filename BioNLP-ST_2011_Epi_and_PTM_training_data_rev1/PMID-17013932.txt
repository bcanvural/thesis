Glycosylation of an immunoglobulin produced from a murine hybridoma cell line: the effect of culture mode and the anti-apoptotic gene, bcl-2. 
The impact of bcl-2 over-expression on the glycosylation pattern of an antibody produced by a bcl-2 transfected hybridoma cell line (TB/C3.bcl-2) was investigated in suspension batch, continuous and high cell density culture (Flat hollow fibre, Tecnomouse system). In all culture modes bcl-2 over-expression resulted in higher cell viability. Analysis of the glycans from the IgG of batch cultures showed that >95% of the structures were neutral core fucosylated asialo biantennary oligosaccharides with variable terminal galactosylation (G0f, G1f and G2f) consistent with previous analysis of glycans from the conserved site at Asn-297 of the IgG protein. The galactosylation index (GI) was determined as an indicator of the glycan profile (=(G2 + 0.5* G1)/(G0 + G1 + G2)). GI values in control cultures were comparable to bcl-2 cultures during exponential growth (0.53) but declined toward the end of the culture when there was a loss in cell viability. Low dilution rates in chemostat culture were associated with reduced galactosylation of the IgG glycans in both cell lines. However, at the higher dilution rates the GI for IgG was consistently higher in the TB/C3.bcl-2 cultures. In the hollow fibre bioreactor the galactosylation of the IgG glycans was considerably lower than in suspension batch or continuous cultures with GI values averaging 0.38. Similar low galactosylation values have been found previously for high density cell cultures and these are consistent with the low values obtained when the dissolved oxygen level is maintained at a low value (10%) in controlled suspension cultures of hybridomas.
