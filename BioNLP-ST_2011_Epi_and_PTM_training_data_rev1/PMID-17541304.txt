EZH2 polycomb transcriptional repressor expression correlates with methylation of the APAF-1 gene in superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. 
The EZH2 gene controls methylation of various EZH2 target promoters. The APAF-1, DAPK-1 und IGFBP-3 genes are frequently methylated in bladder cancer, and methylation of these genes is found in more aggressive tumor types. The aim of our study was to investigate a potential link between EZH2 mRNA expression and the extent of APAF-1, DAPK-1 and IGFBP-3 methylation in urothelial transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) and to correlate the data with histopathological parameters and follow-up data. EZH2 mRNA expression was measured by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and the methylation analysis was performed using methylation-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction. Tissue specimens were obtained from 35 patients with TCC. EZH2 mRNA expression was detected in all tumor specimens investigated. The EZH2 expression levels correlated well with the differentiation grade of the tumor specimens (p = 0.03), and the APAF-1 methylation correlated with tumor stage (p = 0.0001) and grade (p = 0.004). Matched pair analysis demonstrated a statistically significant correlation between elevated EZH2 mRNA expression and higher methylation levels of APAF-1 in superficial (p = 0.024) and well- differentiated (p = 0.04) TCC. In patients with recurrent TCC, APAF-1 and IGFBP-3 methylation levels were significantly higher (p = 0.03 and p = 0.01, respectively), which was not observed when EZH2 mRNA expression or DAPK-1 methylation levels were related to the clinical outcome. In conclusion, our data show that EZH2 expression and APAF-1 methylation are related to tumor progression and invasiveness. Moreover, these data present first evidence that APAF-1 methylation is related to transcriptional activity of EZH2 expression in early-stage tumor disease of the bladder.
