Expression of histone acetyltransferases was down-regulated in poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1-deficient murine cells. 
NF-kappaB-dependent, as well as human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR)-dependent, reporter gene expression was significantly impaired in cells derived from poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1)-knockout (PARP-1 -/-) mice. In addition, the level of protein acetylation was markedly lower in PARP-1 -/- cells than control (PARP-1 +/+) cells. Surprisingly, the expression levels of histone acetyltransferases (HATs), p300, cAMP response element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP), and p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF), were significantly reduced in PARP-1 -/- cells, as compared with PARP-1 +/+ cells. These results suggest that PARP-1 is required for the proper expression of particular HATs. Since p300 and CBP are coactivators of NF-kappaB, we propose here that PARP-1 participates in NF-kappaB-dependent transcription by means of maintaining the expression of HATs.
