A haploid affair: core histone transitions during spermatogenesis. 
The process of meiosis reduces a diploid cell to four haploid gametes and is accompanied by extensive recombination. Thus, the dynamics of chromatin during meiosis are significantly different than in mitotic cells. As spermatogenesis progresses, there is a widespread reorganization of the haploid genome followed by extensive DNA compaction. It has become increasingly clear that the dynamic composition of chromatin plays a critical role in the activities of enzymes and processes that act upon it. Therefore, an analysis of the role of histone variants and modifications in these processes may shed light upon the mechanisms involved and the control of chromatin structure in general. Histone variants such as histone H3.3, H2AX, and macroH2A appear to play key roles in the various stages of spermiogenesis, in addition to the specifically modulated acetylation of histone H4 (acH4), ubiquitination of histones H2A and H2B (uH2A, uH2B), and phosphorylation of histone H3 (H3p). This review will examine recent discoveries concerning the role of histone modifications and variants during meiosis and spermatogenesis.
