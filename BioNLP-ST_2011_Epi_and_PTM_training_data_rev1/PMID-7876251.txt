Studies on the structure and function of glycosylated and nonglycosylated neu differentiation factors.  Similarities and differences of the alpha and beta isoforms. 
Comparative analyses of both glycosylated and nonglycosylated neu differentiation factor (NDF) isoforms revealed significant similarities and differences of their overall structures and functions. Biophysical analyses confirmed that all NDF isoforms are monomeric, but have an extended ellipsoidal shape in solution. All full-length NDFs are similar in secondary and tertiary structures and they contain no alpha-helix but are abundant in beta-strand structures. A small NDF fragment containing only the epidermal growth factor domain is also rich in beta-strand structures, but exhibits tertiary structure different from the long NDF forms. Monoclonal antibodies that selectively recognize epidermal growth factor domains of human NDF-alpha and -beta can specifically bind the respective NDF-alpha and -beta isoforms independent of NDF origins. Western blot analysis and quantitative binding assays further identify that an NDF preparation produced naturally from Rat1-EJ cells contains both alpha and beta isoforms in a 3 to 2 ratio. In receptor-binding competition experiments, human and rat NDF-beta isoforms have higher affinity than NDF-alpha isoforms. NDF-beta isoforms can dramatically enhance the stimulation of DNA synthesis for transfected NIH3T3 cells that overexpress HER-3 and HER-4 receptors, while NDF-alpha isoforms can only stimulate proliferation of HER-4-transfected cells with lower activity. Taken together, NDF-alpha and -beta isoforms share similar gross protein conformations but are biologically distinct.
