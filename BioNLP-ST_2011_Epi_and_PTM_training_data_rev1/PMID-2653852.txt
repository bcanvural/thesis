Acetylation and deacetylation of histone H4 continue through metaphase with depletion of more-acetylated isoforms and altered site usage. 
Antibodies specific for acetylated isoforms of histone H4 have been used to compare acetylation of this histone in interphase and metaphase cells. Two rabbit antisera (R5 and R6) were used, each specific for H4 molecules acetylated at one of the four possible acetylation sites, namely Lys-5 (R6) and Lys-12 (R5). Both antisera bound preferentially to the more-acetylated H4 isoforms (H4Ac2-4). To test for continued H4 acetylation in metaphase chromosomes. Chinese hamster ovary cells were blocked in metaphase and treated for one hour with the deacetylase inhibitor sodium butyrate. Isolated chromosomes were assayed for H4 acetylation by antibody labeling and flow cytometry. H4 acetylation was increased several fold by this brief butyrate treatment. The increase was in direct proportion to DNA content, with no evidence for exceptionally high- or low-labeling chromosomes. The results demonstrate that a cycle of H4 acetylation and deacetylation continues within metaphase chromosomes. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed labeling to be distributed throughout the chromosome, but with variable intensity. Western blotting and immunostaining with R5 and R6 showed a net reduction in labeling of H4 from metaphase cells, with major reductions in the more-acetylated isoforms H4Ac3-4. In contrast, labeling of H4Ac1 was reduced to a lesser extent (R6) or increased (R5). This increase indicates more frequent use of the acetylation site at lysine 12 in H4Ac1 from metaphase cells.
