Decreased UDP-GlcNAc levels abrogate proliferation control in EMeg32-deficient cells. 
The hexosamine pathway provides UDP-N:-acetylhexosamine donor substrates used in cytosolic and Golgi-mediated glycosylation of proteins and for formation of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors, which tether proteins to the outer plasma membrane. We have recently identified the murine glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN6P) acetyltransferase, EMeg32, as a developmentally regulated enzyme on the route to UDP-N:-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc). Here we describe embryos and cells that have the EMeg32 gene inactivated by homologous recombination. Homozygous mutant embryos die at around embryonic day (E) 7.5 with a general proliferative delay of development. In vitro differentiated EMeg32(-/-) ES cells show reduced proliferation. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) deficient for EMeg32 exhibit defects in proliferation and adhesiveness, which could be complemented by stable re-expression of EMeg32 or by nutritional restoration of intracellular UDP-GlcNAc levels. Reduced UDP-GlcNAc levels predominantly translated into decreased O-GlcNAc modifications of cytosolic and nuclear proteins. Interestingly, growth-impaired EMeg32(-/-) MEFs withstand a number of apoptotic stimuli and express activated PKB/AKT. Thus, EMeg32-dependent UDP-GlcNAc levels influence cell cycle progression and susceptibility to apoptotic stimuli.
