Novel roles for classical factors at the interface between translation termination and initiation. 
The pathway of bacterial ribosome recycling following translation termination has remained obscure. Here, we elucidate two essential steps and describe the roles played by the three translation factors EF-G, RRF, and IF3. Release factor RF3 is known to catalyze the dissociation of RF1 or RF2 from ribosomes after polypeptide release. We show that the next step is dissociation of 50S subunits from the 70S posttermination complex and that it is catalyzed by RRF and EF-G and requires GTP hydrolysis. Removal of deacylated tRNA from the resulting 30S:mRNA:tRNA posttermination complex is then necessary to permit rapid 30S subunit recycling. We show that this step requires initiation factor IF3, whose role was previously thought to be restricted to promoting specific 30S initiation complex formation from free 30S subunits.
