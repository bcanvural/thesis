Hydroxylating activity of frog epidermis tyrosinase. 
Trypsin activated in a similar way both the tyrosine hydroxylase and the dopa-oxidasa activities of frog epidermis tyrosinase. Several electron donors reduced or eliminated the lag period for the hydroxylating enzyme. 4 x 10(-5) M dopa was particularly effective, but without affecting the stationary activity after lag period. Tyrosine hydroxylase had KM = 2.6 X 10(-3) M for tyrosine and 2 x 10(-3) M dopa was a competitive inhibitor with Ki = 5 x 10(-4) M. The enzyme was inactivated during its actuation. Data on thermal denaturation were similar to other obtained from dopa oxidase. Our results tend to confirm our previous hypothesis that the activatory process of the enzyme is accompanied by a spatial unfolding of the enzyme molecule.
