A point mutation in the neu-1 locus causes the neuraminidase defect in the SM/J mouse. 
Lysosomal neuraminidase (sialidase) occurs in a high molecular weight complex with the glycosidase beta-galactosidase and the serine carboxypeptidase protective protein/cathepsin A (PPCA). Association of the enzyme with PPCA is crucial for its correct targeting and lysosomal activation. In man two genetically distinct storage disorders are associated with either a primary or a secondary deficiency of lysosomal neuraminidase: sialidosis and galactosialidosis. In the mouse the naturally occurring inbred strain SM/J presents with a number of phenotypic abnormalities that have been attributed to reduced neuraminidase activity. SM/J mice were originally characterized by their altered sialylation of several lysosomal glycoproteins. This defect was linked to a single gene, neu-1 , on chromosome 17, which was mapped by linkage analysis to the H-2 locus. In addition, these mice have an altered immune response that has also been coupled to a deficiency of the Neu-1 neuraminidase. Here we report the identification in SM/J mice of a single amino acid substitution (L209I) in the Neu-1 protein which is responsible for the partial deficiency of lysosomal neuraminidase. We propose that the reduced activity is caused by the enzyme's altered affinity for its substrate, rather than a change in substrate specificity or turnover rate. The mutant enzyme is correctly compartmentalized in lysosomes and maintains the ability to associate with its activating protein, PPCA. We propose that it is this mutation that is responsible for the SM/J phenotype.
