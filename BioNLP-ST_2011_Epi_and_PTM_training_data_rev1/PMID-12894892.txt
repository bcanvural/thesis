Inactivation of p16 gene in leukemia. 
To determine the frequency of p16 gene inactivation in leukemia cells, and to evaluate their value in the prediction of their clinical outcome. Bone marrow or peripheral blood samples from 48 patients with leukemia were examined by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (MPCR) to detect p16 gene homozygous deletion, and restriction enzyme PCR to detect p16 gene methylation. p16 gene inactivation were detected in 10 of the 48 patients (20.4%). They were five patients with p16 homozygous deletion, and five patients with p16 methylation, respectively. p16 gene inactivation correlates with adverse prognosis features. The patients with p16 inactivation had poor response to chemotherapy, and had significantly shorter survival times than the patients in whom p16 gene was preserved (P<0.001). The inactivation of p16 gene play a key role in the pathogenesis and the progression of some leukemia. The detection of p16 gene is reliable prognostic factor that predict shortened survival times.
