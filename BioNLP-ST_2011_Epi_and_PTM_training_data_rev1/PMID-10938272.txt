Rapid induction of histone hyperacetylation and cellular differentiation in human breast tumor cell lines following degradation of histone deacetylase-1. 
Quinidine inhibits proliferation and promotes cellular differentiation in human breast tumor epithelial cells. Previously we showed quinidine arrested MCF-7 cells in G(1) phase of the cell cycle and led to a G(1) to G(0) transition followed by apoptotic cell death. The present experiments demonstrated that MCF-7, MCF-7ras, T47D, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-435 cells transiently differentiate before undergoing apoptosis in response to quinidine. The cells accumulated lipid droplets, and the cytokeratin 18 cytoskeleton was reorganized. Hyperacetylated histone H4 appeared within 2 h of the addition of quinidine to the medium, and levels were maximal by 24 h. Quinidine-treated MCF-7 cells showed elevated p21(WAF1), hypophosphorylation and suppression of retinoblastoma protein, and down-regulation of cyclin D1, similar to the cell cycle response observed with cells induced to differentiate by histone deacetylase inhibitors, trichostatin A, and trapoxin. Quinidine did not show evidence for direct inhibition of histone deacetylase enzymatic activity in vitro. HDAC1 was undetectable in MCF-7 cells 30 min after addition of quinidine to the growth medium. The proteasome inhibitors MG-132 and lactacystin completely protected HDAC1 from the action of quinidine. We conclude that quinidine is a breast tumor cell differentiating agent that causes the loss of HDAC1 via a proteasomal sensitive mechanism.
