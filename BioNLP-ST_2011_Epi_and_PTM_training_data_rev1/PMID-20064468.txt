SH3 domains from a subset of BAR proteins define a Ubl-binding domain and implicate parkin in synaptic ubiquitination. 
Mutations in the parkin gene are responsible for a common inherited form of Parkinson's disease (PD). Parkin is a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase with an N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain (Ubl). We report here that the parkin Ubl binds SH3 domains from endocytic BAR proteins such as endophilin-A with an affinity comparable to proline-rich domains (PRDs) from well-established SH3 partners. The NMR structure of the Ubl-SH3 complex identifies the PaRK extension, a unique C-terminal motif in the parkin Ubl required for SH3 binding and for parkin-mediated ubiquitination of endophilin-A in vitro. In nerve terminals, conditions that promote phosphorylation enhance the interaction between parkin and endophilin-A and increase the levels of ubiquitinated proteins within PRD-associated synaptic protein complexes in wild-type but not parkin knockout brain. The findings identify a pathway for the recruitment of synaptic substrates to parkin with the potential to explain the defects in synaptic transmission observed in recessive forms of PD.
