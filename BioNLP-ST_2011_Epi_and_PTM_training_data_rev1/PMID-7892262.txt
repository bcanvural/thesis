Activation-dependent carboxyl methylation of neutrophil G-protein gamma subunit. 
The gamma subunits of heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory (G) proteins (G gamma) are post-translationally processed at their C termini by prenylation, proteolysis, and carboxyl methylation. Whereas prenylation of G gamma is required for membrane association of G proteins, the role of carboxyl methylation is unknown. Here we show that human neutrophils express G gamma 2 but not G gamma 3 or G gamma 7 and that carboxyl methylation of G gamma 2 is associated with signal transduction. In a reconstituted cell-free system, neutrophil G gamma 2 was labeled by the methyl donor S-[methyl-3H]adenosyl-L-methionine. Carboxyl methylation was confirmed by alkaline hydrolysis and quantitation of volatile [3H]methanol. Neutrophil G gamma 2 methylation was stimulated by activation of G protein with guanosine 5'-[beta, gamma-thio]triphosphate. We estimate that after 1 hr of G-protein activation at least 6% of the total pool of G gamma 2 was carboxyl-methylated. The inflammatory agonist fMet-Leu-Phe stimulated guanosine 5'-[beta,gamma-thio]triphosphate-dependent carboxyl methylation. Methylation of G gamma 2 was inhibited by the carboxyl methyltransferase inhibitor N-acetyl-S-trans,trans-farnesylcysteine at concentrations that affected signal transduction in neutrophils. These results demonstrate that activation of neutrophil Gi is associated with alpha-carboxyl methyl esterification of G gamma 2 and suggest that carboxyl methylation of G gamma may play a role in signal transduction.
