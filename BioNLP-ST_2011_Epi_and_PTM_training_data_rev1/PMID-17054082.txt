Assessing the instability of the isoelectric focusing patterns of erythropoietin in urine. 
IEF can be used to differentiate human urinary erythropoietin (uEPO), recombinant human erythropoietin or epoetin (rEPO) and darbepoetin (novel erythropoiesis stimulating protein (NESP)). This is the basis of the method currently used to detect misuse of rEPO and NESP by elite athletes. Recently, an unknown activity has been attributed to some urine samples (denominated 'unstable' urine by the World Anti-Doping Agency; WADA). This activity has shown to give rise to artefactual profiles for both rEPO and NESP when incubated with such urine and, thus, raised concerns with respect to doping control. We have evaluated which charges produce the characteristic IEF profiles of uEPO, rEPO and NESP and how these profiles respond to distinct enzymatic reactions. From sialidase digestions it became evident that only uEPO contains charges different from sialic acid, and a comparison of all substances after complete de-N-glycosylation localized these charges in the carbohydrate moiety. Partial desialylation, or digestion with arylsulfatase from Helix pomatia yielded profiles for recombinants species similar to those observed for unstable urine samples. The contributions from our studies to the anti-doping problem include: (i) protocols that may corroborate the potential misuse of rEPO or NESP based on the particular enzymatic activity of an arylsulfatase preparation, or a broad-specificity sialidase; (ii) assurance that the instability observed in some urine samples may only result from false-negatives, but not from false-positive testing; and (iii) a simple remedy to prevent an unstable urine from altering the IEF profile by adding selective competitive substrates.
