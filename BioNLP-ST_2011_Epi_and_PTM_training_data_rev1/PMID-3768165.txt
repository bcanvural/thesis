Further characterization of the posttranslational modifications of core histones in response to heat and arsenite stress in Drosophila. 
The effects of a heat shock or arsenite treatment on the methylation and acetylation of core histones have been investigated in Drosophila cultured cells. The decrease in H3 methylation, which is observed during a heat shock, is not a demethylation process, but results from methylation arrest. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis leaves no ambiguity concerning the identity of H2B as a methylated protein, since H2B and D2, a nuclear nonhistone protein, which comigrate on one-dimensional gels, are well separated on these gels. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis in the presence of Triton X-100 resolves each of the core histones into multiple forms resulting from posttranslational modifications. There are apparently, however, no histone variants in cultured Drosophila cells. At 23 degrees C, the various forms of the core histones resolved on two-dimensional gels are methylated. Under heat-shock or arsenite treatment, the methylation of all forms of H3 is decreased, while that of the various forms of H2B increase. These stress conditions also induce a generalized diminution in the acetylation of all forms of core histones. In the course of a heat shock, the synthesis of H2B is increased and this newly synthesized histone remains unacetylated during the shock. These changes in the patterns of core histone methylation and acetylation may be correlated with the reorganization of gene activity brought about by the heat shock.
