DNA methylation patterns in the calcitonin gene region at first diagnosis and at relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). 
Aberrant DNA methylation can occur early in neoplastic transformation and may lead to the development of cancer. We describe the alterations of methylation patterns at the DNA sequence level which occurred in the 5' region of the calcitonin gene in lymphoblasts from 14 pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The DNA methylation status of 25 CpG sites was determined by sequence analysis after bisulfite treatment of the DNA. This method showed that 13 out of 14 patients had increased numbers of methylated CpG sites in the calcitonin gene region at initial diagnosis when compared to control DNA from healthy individuals. The 5' region of the calcitonin gene appears to be methylated to a significantly higher degree in T lineage ALL compared to B lineage ALL (P < 0.01). Each of six ALL patients who were investigated at initial diagnosis and at relapse showed alterations in DNA methylation between the two stages. These six cases were also investigated by Southern blot analysis with methylcytosine-sensitive restriction enzymes and this method showed an increase in DNA methylation in only four of the six cases. The DNA sequencing method thus appears to be better suited to assess alterations of DNA methylation than Southern blot analysis. There are marked regional differences in the frequency of methylation of individual CpG sites and in the frequency of alterations between the two stages. Our results show that alterations in DNA methylation continue to occur from the initial stage to the relapse stage of ALL, suggesting that aberrant DNA methylation may play a role in tumor progression.
