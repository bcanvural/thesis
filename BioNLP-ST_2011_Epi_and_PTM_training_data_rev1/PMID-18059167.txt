Inhibition of Stat3 activity by YC-1 enhances chemo-sensitivity in hepatocellular carcinoma. 
The present study investigated the effect of YC-1, a novel anti-cancer agent, on the chemo-sensitivity of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). YC-1 was administered with chemo-cytotoxic drug, cisplatin, both in vitro and in vivo. YC-1 alone downregulated the expression of phosphorylated form of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (P-Stat3[705]), a key mediator in chemo-resistance. When combined with cisplatin, YC-1 further promoted tumor cell apoptosis, decreased the expression of P-Stat3(705), Bcl-xL, CyclinD1 and survivin, and induced the cleavage of caspase 9 and PARP. Overexpression of Stat3 reversed YC-1 induced cell death. YC-1 inhibited Stat3 activity by enhancing the polyubiquitination of P-Stat3(705) induced by cisplatin. In the in vivo setting, YC-1 combined with cisplatin remarkably suppressed tumor growth in a HCC xenograft model, and this effect was also accompanied by YC-1 mediated downregulation of P-Stat3(705), Bcl-xL, Cyclin D1 and survivin, and induction of cleaved caspase 9 and PARP in the tumor tissues. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated a novel anti-cancer effect of YC-1 in enhancing chemo-sensitivity of HCC cells to cisplatin through a Stat3 dependent manner. This finding provides insight into design of a new therapeutic strategy to improve efficacy of chemotherapy in HCC patients.
