Type XIII collagen forms homotrimers with three triple helical collagenous domains and its association into disulfide-bonded trimers is enhanced by prolyl 4-hydroxylase. 
Type XIII collagen is a type II transmembrane protein predicted to consist of a short cytosolic domain, a single transmembrane domain, and three collagenous domains flanked by noncollagenous sequences. Previous studies on mRNAs indicate that the structures of the collagenous domain closest to the cell membrane, COL1, the adjacent noncollagenous domain, NC2, and the C-terminal domains COL3 and NC4 are subject to alternative splicing. In order to extend studies of type XIII collagen from cDNAs to the protein level we have produced it in insect cells by means of baculoviruses. Type XIII collagen alpha chains were found to associate into disulfide-bonded trimers, and hydroxylation of proline residues dramatically enhanced this association. This protein contains altogether eight cysteine residues, and interchain disulfide bonds could be located in the NC1 domain and possibly at the junction of COL1 and NC2, while the two cysteine residues in NC4 are likely to form intrachain bonds. Pepsin and trypsin/chymotrypsin digestions indicated that the type XIII collagen alpha chains form homotrimers whose three collagenous domains are in triple helical conformation. The thermal stabilities (T(m)) of the COL1, COL2, and COL3 domains were 38, 49 and 40 degrees C, respectively. The T(m) of the central collagenous domain is unusually high, which in the light of this domain being invariant in terms of alternative splicing suggests that the central portion of the molecule may have an important role in the stability of the molecule. All in all, most of the type XIII collagen ectodomain appears to be present in triple helical conformation, which is in clear contrast to the short or highly interrupted triple helical domains of the other known collagenous transmembrane proteins.
