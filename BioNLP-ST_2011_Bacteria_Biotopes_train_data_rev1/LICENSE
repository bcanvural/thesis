    * documents whose idendifier starts with a `1' come from NCBI Genome Project Overview web pages owned and maintained by the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM);
    NLM data are produced by a U.S. Government agency and include works of the United States Government that are not protected by U.S. copyright law but may be protected by non-US copyright law, as well as abstracts originating from publications that may be protected by U.S. copyright law.

Persons contemplating any type of transmission or reproduction of copyrighted material such as abstracts are advised to consult legal counsel.


    * documents whose idendifier starts with a `2' come from the Microbial Genomics Program web pages, owned and maintained by the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) at the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE);
    The Copyright of these documents is held by the Regents of the University of California.


    * documents whose idendifier starts with a `3' come from the Genoscope Sequencing projects web pages, owned and maintained by Genosope at the Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique (CEA);
    The Copyright of these documents is held by Genoscope - Centre National de Séquençage.


    * documents whose idendifier starts with a `5' come from the 2CAN Karyn's Genomes web pages, owned and maintained by the European Centre for Bioinformatics Institute (EBI);
    The Copyright of these documents is held by European Centre for Bioinformatics Institute.


    * documents whose idendifier starts with a `6' come from the MicrobeWiki article pages, owned and maintained by the Kenyon College, Gambier, Ohio, USA.
    The MicrobeWiki does not claim copyright for the material on its pages, it states: "Copyright notice. Readers may view, browse, and/or download material for noncommercial personal purposes.

2. Copyright of annotations
The annotations attached to the abstracts are the results of considerable effort by the MIG Laboratory, Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA). As such, it is copyrighted in its entirety by INRA.


3. Distribution

Since the Bacteria Biotopes corpus contains documents from web servers owned by different entities, distribution of it is subjected to the terms as stated on their respective servers:
    * NLM: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/About/disclaimer.html
    * JGI: http://www.jgi.doe.gov/whoweare/disclaimer.html
    * EBI: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Information/termsofuse.html
    * MicrobeWiki: http://microbewiki.kenyon.edu/index.php/MicrobeWiki:Privacy_policy

Under that condition, the Bacteria Biotopes corpus and annotation may be distributed, with the understanding that the annotations are to be used primarily for scholarly research in natural language processing (NLP), information extraction (IE), and other relevant disciplines.


4. Reproduction
The annotations in the Bacteria Biotopes corpus may be used to produce other data, information systems or services only for bona fide research of a non-profit nature. Users of those derived data, systems or services must be provided a clear description of how the data/system/service was derived, indicating the source of data: NCBI, JGI, EBI, Genoscope, MicrobeWiki and INRA.


5. Commercial Use
Commercial or non-academic organisations wishing to make public use of part or all of the corpus must obtain permission from MIG laboratory, INRA.
