  "companyDescription": "We've come a long way since making the first ever mobile call in the on 1 January 1985.  Today,  more than 403 million customers around the world choose us to look after their communications needs.  In 25 years,  a small mobile operator in Newbury has grown into a global business and the seventh most valuable brand in the world.  We now operate in more than 30 countries and partner with networks in over 50 more. True to our origins,  Vodafone has always committed to deliver useful and inspiring innovation.  In 1991 we enabled the world’s first international mobile roaming call.  In 2002,  with Vodafone Live! we set a new standard for mobile communications with internet access on the move.  Fuelled by the desire for sustainable innovation,  we recently introduced Vodafone Money Transfer which allows customers in emerging markets to send and receive money safely and easily using their mobile phone.  We’ve also caused a stir in the industry with the Vodafone 150 – our most affordable ultra low cost handset yet. We’re a brand that loves change – if it’s not happening naturally then we’re creating it ourselves.  It’s in our DNA to push forward,  to create a better future,  to never rest and find new ways that help people communicate.  That’s the lifeblood that runs throughout Vodafone.  We are driven to empower people. To find that spark that empowers you is why we are in business.  That’s what we mean when we say ‘power to you’. ",
