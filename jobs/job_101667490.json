  "description": "    Wearable devices are the new frontier in the technological world.  They    bring new challenges: huge amounts of data are gathered,  new    algorithmic approaches are required to make sense with the data and new    applications and usages are needed to provide great experiences to the    users.     So,  If    You are thrilled by solving real world problems with data driving the    solutions,     you believe that machine learning and real life understanding can    co-exist,     you suffer from the abuse people are making to the p-value,     you are excited when your model crosses the 90% F-measure line,     you think the kernel trick is much better than any magic trick,     and most importantly - you enjoy making a positive impact on people's    life,     come join us at the Data Science team with Intel's Wearable Devices    Group in Yakum.  Our team is a fast growing team developing state of the    art machine learning & user behavioral models and data driven features    for Intel's wearable devices.  We face extremely interesting challenges    and you are invited to join us,  help us solving those challenges and    empower our users.     Job Category    Engineering    Primary Location    Israel--    Full/Part Time    Full Time    Job Type    Experienced    Regular/Temporary    Regular    Posting Date    Nov 26,  2015    Apply Before    Ongoing    Business Group    The New Devices Group is charged with developing products and    technologies that will enhance and extend Intel’s product portfolio    into new areas of computing,  including wearable technology.

The job is at Intel Yakum There are daily shuttles from Rakevet Merkaz    (morning and afternoon)    Posting Statement    N/A    You constantly use predictive modeling,  probability & statistics,     Machine Learning,  Data Mining,  Information Retrieval,  and any other    data analysis & algorithm development techniques to collect,  explore,     and develop new algorithms and ideas from structured and unstructured    data.     We are a software team so at the end of the day,  you will need to    transform your models into user facing working production code.  You    will perform large scale experimentation & analysis and build data    driven apps to translate data into intelligence.     You have experience with research methodologies,  maybe wrote a paper or    two and have a MSc/PhD.     You probably already developed a few models or algorithms that were    part of a real product.  Definitely you should also be a team player!    You should have programming experience in any language of the following    - Java/C++/C#/Python/R/Matlab    You must possess strong understanding of product & user requirements    and have strong written and communication skills (we don't work in a    bubble).
