Anson McCade Ltd is an established and well-respected IT & Capital    Markets recruitment agency based in the City of London.  Our success has    been achieved by a no-nonsense approach to recruitment,  where the    Client can rely on a dedicated and personal service based on both rapid    response and long-term delivery principles.     Anson McCade is aware that the straightforward matching of skills    fulfils only a fraction of our Clients' requirements.  Therefore we    operate a more holistic approach to the evaluation of a candidate for    each Client,  placing equal emphasis on their precise technical skills,     personal qualities and aspirations.  This has been achieved by    extensive,  comprehensive and continual training within Anson McCade.     The result is the provision of a high quality service to a wide range    of long-term Clients,  who can rely on high calibre candidates being    presented and therefore a high cvs-to-interviews-to-placement ratio.     Anson McCade's traditional marketplace is to supply experienced,  senior    contract and permanent IT & Front/Middle Office staff to high profile    industry sectors from Banking and Hedge Funds to Consultancies and    Media organisations.
