  "companyDescription": "      Keele University    Keele University Sustainability Hub acts as a focus for the research    into,  teaching of,  and management for sustainability and green    technology that takes place at Keele University.  It is a means to bring    all these different activities in disparate units together and then to    communicate the innovations and implications out to the rest of campus,     businesses and the wider community.     The Hub is not just a building it is a community.  It facilitates    communication and interaction from one section of the interconnected    community to another.  It allows researchers to find out about other    research on campus and may help interdisciplinary research.  It allows    students to find out about research or courses they may want to get    involved with.  Visitors from the community can come in and see displays    on the latest research happening at the university and may become    involved in some of our outreach activities.  Businesses can find out    about green technologies and explore how they could add value to their    products.     Keele is an ideal site for this kind of Sustainability Hub because of    its central location,  its large green campus,  the interdisciplinary    nature of its degrees and research and its existing green practices.     Keele is close to the geographic centre of England,  adjacent to the M6    motorway and halfway between the major metropolitan areas of Birmingham    and Greater Manchester (the two largest urban areas outside London).     Despite its rural location it is very close to the Potteries urban area    and so is ideally placed to address issues related to sustainability in    both types of communities. ",
