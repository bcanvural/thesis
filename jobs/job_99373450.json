      "rawText": " Leeds Anniversary Research Scholarship - Open to allSchool of Electronic and Electrical EngineeringVery large data sets are currently generated as a result of increased real time sensing and measurements in a range of fields from healthcare to smart cities.  Radically different network architecture and protocols are needed to support the expected growth and new functionalities are required.  Simple devices are expected in future to gain and provide significant levels of intelligence by linking to the Internet.  The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to grow to over 100 billion devices linking a wide range of consumer,  business and industrial devices to the Internet.   The focus of this studentship is to develop network architectures and protocols that provide resilience,  scalability and low power consumption in future Big data and IoT networks.   The PhD studentship will provide a good opportunity to work within the world class Communication Networks and Systems group in the School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering,  University of Leeds,  and link with the industrial collaborators and academic partners on the different projects within the group. Value: This studentship,  which is open to UK,  EU and international students,  will cover academic fees and a maintenance of £14, 254 in 2016/17.  Number of awards: 1 Entry requirements: Applicants must have a minimum of a UK upper second class honours degree (2. 1),  or equivalent,  in electronic/electrical engineering,  physics,  or mathematics. If English is not the applicant’s first language,  they must provide evidence that they meet the University’s minimum English Language requirements. Main contact: Contact Professor Jaafar Elmirghani to discuss this project further informally. Application deadline: Friday 15 January 2016How To ApplyApplications for this scheme will open on Friday 30th October.  This is when details about the application process will be made available.
