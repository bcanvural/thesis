  "description": "Illumina are seeking a Bioinformatics Scientist / Data Analyst to join the multi-disciplinary computational biology team.  This is research oriented role focused on the analysis of Illumina’s DNA sequencing technology.  The role will require the successful candidate to analyse data from existing and emerging technologies,  interpret the results and communicate them effectively.    This role will focus on the analysis and interpretation of NGS data proving support to a range of technology development teams.  The type of projects a successful candidate could support is variant calling development projects,  analysing data from novel technologies and prototyping new analysis methods.    Potential projects that these types of roles often cover are Analysis of large datasets such as gold standard datasets and population analysis Novel Algorithm Development (variant calling,  alignment,  graph assemblies,  de novo callers etc) Analysis of metrics for existing sequencing instruments and new technologies   We are seeking exceptional individuals who enjoy working in a highly collaborative and fast paced R&amp;D environment.  They should be confident working both individually and in project teams,  and have a strong background in analysing NGS data,  leading to rigorous interpretation of data.      This role would suit candidates that have a solid background in statistics and data analysis that would like to apply their skill set to product development within the field of genomics.   This is a highly applied role which would involve working on real-world data sets that have a direct impact on the development of Illumina’s core technologies.   "
