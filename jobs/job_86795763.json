  "companyDescription": "About SAS:   Data is more than just facts and figures.  It can tell a story – the past,  the present and,  potentially,  the future of an organisation,  an industry or even a nation.  But without a good storyteller to bring it to life,  data is like an unwritten book.  It’s our job at SAS to be great storytellers.  With our advanced analytics tools,  we transform data into insights that tell the true story about an organisation.  We help people understand what’s really working in their businesses,  fix what isn’t and discover new opportunities.    For almost 40 years we’ve been giving our customers the power to know and through constant innovation we’ve remained the leader in analytics software and services.    Yes SAS makes great software,  but it’s our people who make the real difference.  Our people look beyond facts and figures to deliver the insights our customers need.  We want our people to truly love what they do – so we’ve worked hard to establish a culture that fosters creativity,  collaboration and innovation.  ",
