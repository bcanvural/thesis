We already know    of an excellent candidate with top analytical and programming skills.     Unfortunately,  we don't know her exact whereabouts but we only have    some vague information where she might be.  Can you tell us where to    best send our recruiters and plot an easy to read map of your solution    for them? This is what we could extract from independent sources: The    candidate is likely to be close to the river Spree.  The probability at    any point is given by a Gaussian function of its shortest distance to    the river.  The function peaks at zero and has 95% of its total integral    within +/-2730m A probability distribution centered around the    Brandenburg Gate also informs us of the candidate's location.  The    distribution’s radial profile is log-normal with a mean of 4700m and a    mode of 3877m in every direction.  A satellite offers further    information: with 95% probability she is located within 2400 m distance    of the satellite’s path (assuming a normal probability distribution)    Please make use of the additional information in the file    http://bit. ly/19fdgVa.
