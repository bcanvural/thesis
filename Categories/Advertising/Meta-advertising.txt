Advertisements about Advertisements

The most common definition of meta-advertising is an ad about an ad. This form of advertising is popular with Super Bowl advertising. Super Bowl ads and spots cost far more than regular ads.[4] The Super Bowl ads are highly anticipated. This often leads the companies to air ads encouraging viewers to watch the companies' upcoming Super Bowl ads, a form of meta-advertising.

Advertising about advertisements is a form of viral advertising, whereby advertisers seek to garner attention for their ad and therefore product.[5][6]

Other examples include advertisements in one form of media, advertising for an ad in another medium. This could include a radio ad saying "Look in your Sunday paper for a free coupon."
Advertising for Advertising Agencies

Meta-advertising can also include ads which advertise for advertising. This is common with billboards, such as a billboard that says "A thousand people will pass by this billboard today. To advertise here call..."
