Cloudera
Cloudera Inc. is an American-based software company that provides Apache Hadoop-based software, support and services, and training to business customers.

Cloudera's open-source Apache Hadoop distribution, CDH (Cloudera Distribution Including Apache Hadoop), targets enterprise-class deployments of that technology. Cloudera says that more than 50% of its engineering output is donated upstream to the various Apache-licensed open source projects (Apache Hive, Apache Avro, Apache HBase, and so on) that combine to form the Hadoop platform. Cloudera is also a sponsor of the Apache Software Foundation.[2]


Three engineers from Google, Yahoo and Facebook (Christophe Bisciglia, Amr Awadallah and Jeff Hammerbacher, respectively) joined with a former Oracle executive (Mike Olson) to form Cloudera in 2008.[3] Olson was the CEO of Sleepycat Software, the creator of the open-source embedded database engine Berkeley DB (acquired by Oracle in 2006). Awadallah was from Yahoo, where he ran one of the first business units using Hadoop for data analysis.[4] At Facebook Hammerbacher used Hadoop for building analytic applications involving massive volumes of user data.[5]

Architect Doug Cutting, also a former chairman of the Apache Software Foundation, authored the open-source Lucene and Nutch search technologies before he wrote the initial Hadoop software in 2004. He designed and managed a Hadoop storage and analysis cluster at Yahoo! before joining Cloudera in 2009. Chief operating officer was Kirk Dunn.[6]

In March 2009, Cloudera announced the availability of Cloudera Distribution Including Apache Hadoop in conjunction with a $5 million investment led by Accel Partners.[7] In 2011, the company raised a further $40 million from Ignition Partners, Accel Partners, Greylock Partners, Meritech Capital Partners, and In-Q-Tel, a venture capital firm with open connections to the CIA.[8]

In June 2013 Tom Reilly became chief executive, although Olson remained as chairman of the board and chief strategist. Reilly was chief executive at ArcSight when it was acquired by Hewlett-Packard in 2010.[9] In March 2014 Cloudera announced a $900 million funding round, led by Intel Capital ($740 million), for that Intel received 18% share in cloudera and Intel dropped its own Hadoop distribution and dedicated 70 Intel engineers to work exclusively on cloudera projects. With additional funds coming from T Rowe Price, Google Ventures and an affiliate of MSD Capital, L.P., the private investment firm for Michael S. Dell. and others.[10]
