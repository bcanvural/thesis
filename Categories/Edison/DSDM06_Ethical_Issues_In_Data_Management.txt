Maximising Contribution: Archiving data 

Archiving data for secondary analysis 

Seen as ethical practice 

Ability to validate and refine or refute published 
findings using publically available data (Albright 
& Lyle, 2010). 

May ensure greater transparency of data 
(
Arrison
 et al., 2009; 
Carusi
 & 
Jirotka
, 2009).  

Reduces burden of repeat data collection on 
particpants
 (
Corti
 et al., 2000).  
Ongoing debate regarding archiving 
qualitative data ...  
Less debate in the literature regarding 
quantitative archiving 

“Preparing and preserving all data for sharing is 
perhaps even more wasteful of scientific and social 
resources as destroying all data after their first use. 
The ethical dilemma, then, is to discover the most 
intelligent course through a thicket of ever-shifting 
circumstances surrounding the preparation, storage, 
and ultimate secondary usefulness of data” (
Sieber
, 
2005, p.165). 
Respecting Privacy 

Quantitative data assumed to be less identifiable 

Albright and Lyle (2010)  

Concerns regarding impact of technology on the 
potential to identify participants in quantitative 
research  

Masking of potentially identifiable data though 

Data swapping,  

Microaggregation,  

Adding random observations
Awareness 

Are researchers aware of the benefits and 
challenges of archiving data? 

Relatively recent phenomenon for many disciplines 

Good vs best practice? 

Changing legislative framework 
Issues ... 

When is an archive not an archive? 

Distinction between formal managed archives 
and researchers holding data for personal use. 

Ethical issues in personal archives (who 
manages them) 

Must ensure data quality 

“Each set of data an investigator obtains is a 
slice of reality that may or may not be valid or 
reliable” (
Sieber
, 2005, p.166)
