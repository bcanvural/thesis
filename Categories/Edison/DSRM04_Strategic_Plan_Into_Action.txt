Step 1: Define your strategic focus areas.

Strategic focus areas represent big buckets of activity. Take your strategic plan and define these buckets. There should be at least three, but no more than 7.

Step 2: Create at least one measurable outcome for each focus area.

Within each focus area, what does success look like? Define the characteristics of success -- what people will see, feel, think, do, if you are successful -- and then figure out how you will measure each characteristic. If you can, outline a simple, aggressive target for each characteristic. Success comes with multiple characteristics for each outcome, so don't just focus on one number.

Step 3: Design Pathfinder Projects with milestones.

To reach your outcome you will need at least one project. We call these "Pathfinder Projects" because, in truth, you don't know what will work. Just like outcomes, though, you need to be crystal clear in defining a Pathfinder Project.

The best way to get clarity is by setting commonsense milestones. That way, you can tell if your project is getting off course, or worse yet, not working at all. Your milestones alert you to failure. When you fail early, you fail cheaply...and you learn.

Step 4: Draft a short Strategic Action Plan.

Outcomes and projects provide two key components to your strategy, but you do not move a strategy into action without a Strategic Action Plan, continuously revised. If you do not know what you are going to do next week to advance your strategy, chances are your strategic plan is going nowhere. Your Strategic Action Plan outlines next steps and who is responsible for taking them.

Step 5: Commit to a 30 day review process.

We learn what works by doing. Making adjustments along the way is critical to a successful strategy. A 30 day review process keeps you focused and enables you to make regular adjustments to your strategy. In today's world, strategy is like software development. You need to commit to continuous revision
