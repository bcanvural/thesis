Abstract 
e-Science – or e-Research - enables new forms and layers of research. It generates massive amounts 
of data, at different research stages. Yet the many 
technologies used also transform data and put its 
integrity  at  risk.  Readability  and  usefulness  are  je
opardized  not  just  by  technical  factors.  Data’s  
future  quality  –  richness,  trustworthiness  –is  a  func
tion  of  investment  in  it.  But  should  all  data  be  
kept?  What  other  issues  arise,  for  whom?  We  highlight  findings  of  the  recent  e-Science  Data  
Curation  report  commissioned  by  JISC  with  the  s
upport  of  the  e-Science  Core  Programme,  and  
present  the  Digital  Curation  Centre,  the  first  of  its  kind  in  the  world,  and  its  role  in  providing  
resources and support for digital curation and research. 
1.   Introduction 
The volume of data being created is growing at 
an astonishing rate
i
. E-Science, or perhaps more 
inclusively  e-Research,  enables  a  new  order  of  
collaborative,  more  inter-disciplinary  research,  
based  on  shared  research  expertise,  instruments  
and    computing    resources,    and,    crucially,    
increasing   access   to   collections   of   primary   
research  data  and  information.    This  is  the  
knowledge base of research.   
There  are  challenges,  however:    these  same  
technology changes and the flexibility in use of 
information  technology  tools  put  the  very  data  
they   create   and   transform   at   risk   and   raise   
serious  and  complex  issues  of  strategy,  policy  
and      practice      regarding      the      creation,      
management,  and  long-term  care  of  data  –  its  
curation. 
A recent study
ii
 commissioned by the JISC Joint 
Committee for the 
Support of Research showed 
that  much  needs  to  be  done  at  all  levels  to  
enable  the  data  which  is  being  created  by  this  
revolution   to   remain   available   and   valid   to   
future  researchers.  And  much  is  being  done  by  
the  e-Science  community,  
in  projects,  research  
and other initiatives, and which will be reported 
at the e-Science All Hand
s Meeting of 2004.  As 
part  of  their  response  to  this  problem,  the  JISC  
and   e-Science   Core   Programme   are   jointly   
funding  the  newly  established  Digital  Curation  
Centre (DCC)
iii
.  Its remit is to provide practical 
guidance and outreach concerning data curation, 
and  to  undertake  research  into  digital  curation.    
The  DCC  is  the  first  initiative  of  its  kind  in  the  
world,  and  is  expected  to  become  a  centre  of  
excellence in the area. 
In this paper we highlight some of the technical, 
strategic and policy findings emerging from the 
e-Science  Data  Curation  report  and  discuss  the  
DCC’s  role  in  addressing
  some  of  the  practical  
challenges to be addressed. 
2.   e-Science Curation 
This is a relatively new field, and terminologies 
are not yet stable.  We have used the following 
working definitions of three key activities:  
•
Curation:    
The  activity  of  managing  and  
promoting  the  use  of  data  from  its  point  of  
creation,  to  ensure  it  is  fit  for  contemporary  
purpose,  and  available  for  discovery  and  re-
use.    For  dynamic  datasets  this  may  mean  
continuous enrichment or updating to keep it 
fit for purpose. Higher levels of curation will 
also     involve     maintaining     links     with     
annotation and other published materials. 
•
Archiving: 
A    curation    activity    which    
ensures that data is properly selected, stored, 
can  be  accessed  and  that  its  logical  and  
physical  integrity  is  maintained  over  time,  
including security and authenticity. 
•
Preservation
:    An  activity  within  archiving  
in    which    specific    items    of    data    are    
maintained over time so that they can still be 
accessed and understood through changes in 
technology.

2.1   Survey Findings 
The  e-Science  Curation  report  surveyed  and  
reported  on  the  provision  of  curation  for  e-
Science  data  in  the  UK,  listing  some  13  major  
findings,        and        making        ten        major        
recommendations for action at a strategic level. 
Strategic   and   policy   level   findings   are   not   
presented  in  detail  here,  but  in  summary  they  
showed that: 
•
Urgent  action  was  needed  for  the  UK  to  
capitalize  on  the  opportunities  presented  by  
e-Science. 
•
Action  was  needed  to  address  a  short-term  
funding  regime  which  mitigates  against  the  
essentially long-term needs of data curation. 
•
Before   data-based   research   can   flourish,   
questions  of  trust  in  data  (and  data  as  it  
ages) need to be addressed, such as security, 
confidentiality,  ownership,  provenance  and  
authenticity. 
•
Awareness  of  long-term  data  curation  was  
generally  low  among  research  workers,  and  
researchers need to be encouraged to engage 
more in the curation of their own data. 
•
Provision  of  services  for  curation  tended  to  
be  patchy,  but  was  more  advanced  in  some  
areas – particularly areas concerning the bio-
sciences  and  in  “big”,  collaborative  science  
such as astronomy and particle physics. 
Areas  for  further  research,  debate  and  action  
include: 
Preservation:      
How   is   data   to   survive   the   
constant   changes   in   information   technology,   
which  sees  the  rapid  obsolescence  of  hardware  
architectures   and   software   and   file   formats?   
How  do  we  decide  to  keep  what,  and  how?    
Various    proposals    have    been    made    for    
addressing  this  problem,  but  the  area  remains  
one    where    more    work    is    required,    both    
theoretical and practical. 
Awareness  and  compliance:    
The  viability  of  
data over the longer term depends on awareness.  
This  means  that  the  originators  of  data,  or  of  
data annotation need to be
 aware of the issues of 
preservation and curation, and they also need to 
be given practical guidance to be engaged in the 
process.    Forums    such    as    the    e-Science    
programme  and  the  All  Hands  Meetings  are  
opportunities to spread the curation word, and to 
encourage our audience to 
do so too. Of course, 
there needs to be awareness at all levels.   
Trust:      
As   we   noted   above,   in   a   digital   
environment  it  is  not  obvious  how  to  engender  
trust  in  data  which  has  been  passed  on  to  us.    
How  can  we  be  sure  of  its  provenance,  its  
quality,   freedom   from   corruption,   and   its   
continued privacy and security (where that is an 
issue  –  as  in  medical  science)?  We  need  to  
determine  to  what  extent  these  are  real  issues,  
and  for  which  data.    Work  is  proceeding  on  a  
number  of  fronts  –  examples  include  the  work  
being done by Professor Buneman on databases 
and  the  provenance  question,  or  the  Qurator  
project,  looking  at  tools  to  help  discover  and  
document  the  quality  of  information  resources.    
However, we are still a long way from complete 
solutions.   
Data selection
:  What criteria should be applied 
when  selecting  data  for  longer-term  retention?    
Some  data  is  obviously  of  unique  value,  but  
what  else  should  be  kept?    Selection  introduces  
uncertainties   –   how   do   we   know   what   we   
should keep?  Questions of costs and risks arise.  
Who   sets   the   selection   criteria?      How   can   
selection  be  assessed,  when,  by  whom?    Or  
should we keep everything, bearing in mind the 
costs of maintaining it (its curation)?   
The  work  being  carried  out  and  the  tools  being  
developed such as in the e-Science projects will 
contribute  to  the  prac
ticality,  economics  and  
thus  viability  of  data  curation.  Thanks  to  data  
grids,  portals,  defined  taxonomies,  ontologies,  
users  will  be  able  to  discover  data  resources  
(which  may  include  the  metadata  about  data)  
without having to worry about loading the data, 
establishing its reliability, or not finding it in the 
first place because of a spelling error.   
This  work  is  surely  also  important  for  funders:    
on  the  one  hand  it  lightens  the  cost  burden  
entailed in keeping data, and on the other it can 
protect the value of data generated in research. 
Grid    infrastructure    provides    a    distributed    
computing   environment   which   facilitates   the   
creation  and  analysis  of  large  volumes  of  data  
from       e-Research       experimentation       and       
applications.         It   creates   opportunity   for   
versatility  in  model,  as  well  as  opening  the  
knowledge   base   described   above   to   much   
broader research communities. 
Data   curation   is   an   emergent   field   and   an   
exciting  one,  with  many  current  areas  of  active  
research.   
2.1   Curation report recommendations 
The  report’s  findings  led  to  endorsement  of  the  
creation  of  a  Digital  Curation  Centre  in  the  UK  
as  part  of  the  national  provision  of  curation  
facilities.  Since the report was drafted the DCC 
has  become  a  reality,  and  its  programme  of  
work  is  described  briefly  in  section  4  of  this  
paper.  Of the other nine strategic  
Figure 1  Model of the Curation Process 
recommendations   made,   three   are   of   direct   
relevance to the DCC’s programme: 
•
The production of research led-exemplars to 
demonstrate    and    promote    benefits    of    
curation should be co-ordinated by the DCC. 
•
National  and  international  activities  should  
be initiated to promote incentives which will 
foster  a  scientific  culture  of  engagement  in  
data curation. 
•
Educational  materials,  guidelines  and  policy  
documents    for    researchers    need    to    be    
developed and publicized. 
3.   A curation mo
del for e-Sciences 
The  accompanying  diagram  (Figure  1)  shows  a  
model    of    the    newly    emergent    research    
knowledge    cycle.    This    has    three    major    
components:    research    and    data    creation,    
publishing, and the maturing area of curation. 
In  this  model  the  traditional  cycle  of  research  
findings  going  through  the  publications  process  
and back to consumers, the research community 
and other consumers (peers, libraries, the public 
and  industry)  is  shown  to  the  top  and  right  of  
the information flow diagram (indicated in blue 
and  white  on  the  diagram,
  and  referred  to  as  
Level 1 Curation in the report). 
More  recently,  on  the  research  side,  this  has  
been   augmented   by   research   methods   based   
primarily  on  the  re-use  and  interpretation  of  
data  held  in  archives  (indicated  by  red  in  the  
diagram,  and  referred  to  as  Level  2  Curation  in  
the  report).  This  somewhat  enhanced  cycle  is  
exemplified   by   the   work   done   by   social   
scientists re-using data held in repositories such 
as those held by the UK Data Archive (UKDA) 
at  the  University  of  Essex;  similar  models  also  
appear  in  the  life  sciences,  and  within  the  arts  
community  too,  with  the  Arts  and  Humanities  
Data  Service  (AHDS)  –  a  distributed  resource  
with a central base at Kings College, London.   
Another  example  is  the  astronomical  domain  
where  there  are  two  types  of  data  collection  
which  are  common:  observatory  mode  -  where  
data  is  taken  on  behalf  of  the  observer  and  is  
processed    by    the    observatory    system,    as    
opposed  to  principal-investigator  mode  where  
the observer has hands-on control and processes 
data  him/herself.  The  latter  case  is  more  likely  
to pose problems with archiving and curation.

We are now entering a phase where a third level 
of   curation   is   demanded.      In   this   matured   
situation,  data  repositories  which  are  actively  
curated  are  a  reality,  rather  than  mere  archival  
stores. This new part of the information cycle is 
depicted  in  the  lower  left  of  the  diagram  (in  
green).    In  this  phase  the  data  is  not  merely  
stored,   but   is   preserved   to   overcome   the   
technical  obsolescence  problem  noted  above,  
and  is  subject  to  revision  and  enhancement  as  
necessary,   perhaps   augmented   with   tools   to   
assist       discovery,       (re-)exploitation       and       
presentation, such as the use of ontologies.   
We   note   that   accompanying   this   trend   to   
curation   there   is   a   parallel   movement   of   
provision of enhanced bibliographic facilities in 
digital libraries, and even more significantly for 
the   scientific   information   cycle,   there   is   an   
increasing role for enhanced electronic pre-print 
services  (e-Prints)  and  electronic  delivery  of  
completed   articles.      This   trend   has   been   
described in other work sponsored by JISC in its 
initiatives  under  the  e-Research  Programme
vi
and  in  the  Digital  Preservation  and  Continuing  
Access Strategy

A  good  example  of  a  curated  resource  at  this  
level     is     the     UniProt/Swiss-Prot     Protein     
Knowledgebase.      UniProt/Swiss-Prot
x
   is   an   
annotated protein sequence database, which was 
first  established in 1986.  
The  knowledgebase  contains    curated  protein  
sequence  information  that  provides  a  high  level  
of  annotation,  a  minimal  level  of  redundancy  
and    high    level    of    integration    with    other    
databases.  It  is  a  "one-stop  shop"  that  allows  
easy access to all publicly 
available information 
of protein sequence annotation.  It is maintained 
collaboratively    by    the    Swiss    Institute    for    
Bioinformatics     (SIB)     and     the     European     
Bioinformatics   Institute   (EBI).      It   employs   
approximately   100   scientist   in   the   curation   
process.      Release   43.6   (21-Jun-04)   of   the   
knowledgebase    contains
    153320    sequence    
entries,   comprising   56,402,618   amino   acids   
abstracted from 117,067 references. 
4.   The Digital Curation Centre  
The DCC, was awarded funding from 1
st
 March 
2004.    It  is  based  at  the  National  e-Science  
Centre    in    Edinburgh    and    the    consortium    
comprises four partner institutions: 
•
University      of      Edinburgh      (lead,      
Informatics, Law, Information Services 
and research institutes) 
•
University   of   Glasgow   (HATII   and   
Information Services) 
•
UKOLN, University of Bath 
•
Council  for  the  Central  Laboratory  of  
the Research Councils (CCLRC). 
The  DCC  aims  to  provide  a  comprehensive  
advisory  service,  a  repository  of  user  tools  and  
knowledge   base,   outreach   and   dissemination   
activities    including    an    e-journal    and    an    
innovative research programme. 
The   DCC   is   also   forming   an   Associates   
Network  to  provide  a  forum  for  engaging  with  
the   communities   of   practice   and   with   key   
organisations working in this area. 
The  Centre  is  currently  gathering  information  
and  feedback  from  disciplinary  representatives  
and  users,  which  will  inform  the  research  and  
development  initiatives  of  the  Centre  and  will  
begin  the  process  of  building  a  user  base  and  
community network.  
The  DCC  is  also  developing  an  “Approach  to  
Curation”   which   will   inform   and   provide   
underlying  principles  and  technical  standards  
for the curation activity. The DCC is monitoring 
existing  architecture  work  and  developments  
elsewhere  with  the  aim  of  positioning  the  DCC  
research  and  development  programmes  within  
the  wider  landscape.  Further  information  about  
the   DCC   is   presented   in   a   separate   AHM   
poster

5.   Conclusion 
New  avenues  of  research  within  which  digital  
data and its continued care and enhancement are 
central  are  now  emerging.  We  can  expect  to  
become part of the mainst
ream research in a few 
years.  To take best advantage of this nationally 
and  to  contribute  fully  internationally,  strategic  
and  policy  level  recommendations  have  been  
recommended.    These  initiatives  are  required  
both   on   management   and   technical   fronts.   
Action  has  already  been  initiated  on  some  of  
these,  most  notably  with  the  founding  of  the  
Digital   Curation   Centre   this   year,   with   the   
objectives     of     supporting     the     scientific     
community  in  taking  best  advantage  of  new  
opportunities
