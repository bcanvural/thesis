The personality–job fit theory postulates that a person's personality traits will reveal insight as to adaptability within an organization. The degree of confluence between a person and the organization is expressed as their Person-Organization (P-O) fit.[1] This is also referred to as a person–environment fit.[2][3][4] A common measure of the P-O fit is workplace efficacy; the rate at which workers are able to complete tasks. These tasks are mitigated by workplace environs- for example, a worker who works more efficiently as an individual than in a team will have a higher P-O fit for a workplace that stresses individual tasks (such as accountancy).[1] By matching the right personality with the right job, company workers can achieve a better synergy and avoid pitfalls such as high turnover and low job satisfaction. Employees are more likely to stay committed to organizations if the fit is 'good'.

In practice, P-O fit would be used to gauge integration with organizational competencies. The Individual is assessed on these competencies, which reveals efficacy, motivation, influence, and co-worker respect. Competencies can be assessed using various tools like psychological tests, assessment centres competency based interview, situational analysis, etc.

If the Individual displays a high P-O fit, we can say that the Individual would most likely be able to adjust to the company environment and work culture, and would be able to perform at an optimum level.

Buettner proposed a framework for recommender systems searching online social networks for future employees that covers the whole P-O fit.[5] The framework show how the candidate's personality traits and the organization's culture traits can be automatically extracted from online social networks.
