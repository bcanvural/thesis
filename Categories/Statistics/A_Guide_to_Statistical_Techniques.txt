ANCOVA 
gives 
a more 
powerful 
look 
at the 
IV-DV 
relationship 
by 
minimizing 
error 
variance 
(cf. 
Chapter 
3). 
The 
stronger 
the 
relationship 
between 
the 
DV 
and 
the 
covariate(s) 
is, 
the 
greater 
the 
power 
of 
ANCOVA 
over 
ANOVA. 
ANCOVA 
is  discussed 
in 
Chapter 
8. 
ANCOVA 
is 
also 
used 
to 
adjust 
for 
differences 
among 
groups 
when 
groups 
are 
naturally 
occurring 
and 
random 
assignment 
to 
them 
is 
not 
possible. 
For 
example, 
one 
might 
ask 
if 
attitude 
toward 
abortion 
(the 
DV) 
varies 
as 
a function 
of 
religious 
affiliation. 
However, 
it is  not 
possible 
to 
randomly 
assign 
people 
to 
religious 
affiliation. 
In 
this 
situation, 
there 
could 
easily 
be 
other 
system­
atic 
differences 
among 
groups, 
such 
as 
level 
of 
education, 
that 
are 
also 
related 
to 
attitude 
toward 
abortion. 
Apparent 
differences among 
religious 
groups 
might 
well 
be 
due 
to 
differences 
in 
education 
rather 
than 
differences 
in 
religious 
affiliation. 
To 
get 
a "purer" 
measure 
of 
the 
relationship 
between 
attitude 
and 
religious 
affiliation, 
attitude 
scores 
are 
first 
adjusted 
for 
educational 
differences, 
that 
is, 
education 
is 
used 
as 
a  covariate. 
Chapter 
8  also 
discusses 
this 
somewhat 
problematical 
use 
of 
ANCOVA. 
When 
there 
are 
more 
than 
two 
groups, 
planned 
or 
post 
hoc 
comparisons 
are 
available 
in 
ANCOVA 
just 
as 
in 
ANOVA. 
With 
ANCOVA, 
selected 
and/or 
pooled 
group 
means 
are 
adjusted 
for 
differences 
on 
covariates 
before 
differences 
in 
means 
on 
the 
DV 
are 
assessed. 
2.1.2.3 
Factorial 
ANOVA 
Factorial 
ANOVA, 
reviewed 
in 
Chapter 
3, 
is 
the 
subject 
of 
numerous 
statistics 
texts 
(e.g., 
Keppel, 
1991; 
Myers 
& 
Well, 
1991; 
Winer, 
1971; 
Tabachnick 
& 
Fidell, 
2001) 
and 
is 
introduced 
in 
most ele­
mentary 
texts. 
Although 
there 
is only 
one 
DV 
in 
factorial 
ANOVA, 
its 
place 
within 
the general 
linear 
model 
is  discussed 
in 
Chapter 
17.
L
2.1.2.4 
Factorial 
AN~OVA
Factorial 
ANCOVA 
differs from 
one-way 
ANCOVA 
only 
in 
that 
there 
is more 
than 
one 
IV. 
The 
desir­
ability 
and 
use 
of 
covariates 
are 
the 
same. 
For 
instance, 
in 
the 
educational 
therapy 
example 
of 
Sec­
tion 
2.1.2.2, 
another 
interesting 
IV 
might 
be 
gender 
of 
the 
child. 
The 
effects 
of 
gender, 
type 
of 
educational 
therapy, 
and 
their 
interaction 
on 
outcome 
are 
assessed 
after 
adjusting 
for 
age 
and 
prior 
degree 
of 
reading 
disability. 
The 
interaction 
of 
gender 
with 
type 
of 
therapy 
asks 
if 
boys 
and 
girls 
dif­
fer 
as 
to 
which 
type 
of 
educational 
therapy 
is  more 
effective 
after 
adjustment 
for 
covariates. 
2.1.2.5 
Hotelling's 
T2 
Hotelling's 
T 
2 
is 
used 
when 
the 
IV 
has 
only 
two 
groups 
and 
there 
are 
several 
DVs. 
For 
example, 
there 
might 
be 
two 
DV
s, 
such 
as 
score 
on 
an 
academic 
achievement 
test 
and 
attention 
span 
in 
the 
classroom, 
and 
two 
levels 
of 
type 
of 
educational 
therapy, 
emphasis 
on 
perceptual 
training 
versus 
emphasis 
on 
academic 
training. 
It 
is  not 
legitimate 
to 
use 
separate 
t 
tests 
for 
each 
DV 
to 
look 
for 
dif­
ferences 
between 
groups 
because 
that 
inflates 
Type 
I error 
due 
to 
unnecessary 
multiple 
significance 
tests 
with 
(likely) 
correlated 
DVs. 
Instead, 
Hotelling's 
T
2 
is  used 
to 
see 
if 
groups 
differ 
on 
the 
two 
DVs 
combined. 
The 
researcher 
asks 
if 
there 
are 
reliable 
differences 
in 
the centroids 
(average 
on 
the 
combined 
DVs) 
for 
the 
two 
groups. 
Hotelling's 
T 
2 
is 
a special 
case 
of 
multivariate 
analysis 
of 
variance, 
just 
as 
the 
t 
test 
is  a spe­
cial 
case 
of 
univariate 
analysis 
of 
variance, 
when 
the 
IV 
has 
only 
two 
groups. Multivariate 
analysis 
of 
variance 
is 
discussed 
in 
Chapter 
9.

One-
Way 
MANOVA 
\ 
Multivariate 
analysis 
of 
variance 
evaluates 
differences 
among 
centroids 
for 
a set 
of 
DVs 
when 
there 
are 
two 
or 
more 
levels 
of 
an 
IV 
(groups). 
MANOVA 
is  useful 
for 
the 
educational 
therapy 
example 
in 
the 
preceding 
section 
with 
two 
groups 
and 
also 
when 
there 
are 
more 
than two 
groups 
(e.g., 
if 
a non­
treatment control 
group 
is added). 
With 
more 
than 
two 
groups, 
planned 
and 
post 
hoc 
comparisons 
are 
available. 
For 
example, 
if 
a main 
effect 
of 
treatment 
is  found 
in 
MANOVA, 
it might 
be 
interesting 
to 
ask 
post 
hoc 
if 
there 
are 
differences 
in 
the 
centroids 
of 
the 
two 
groups 
given 
different 
types 
of 
educational 
therapy, 
ignoring 
the 
control 
group, 
and, 
possibly, 
if 
the 
centroid 
of 
the 
control 
group 
differs 
from 
the 
centroid 
of 
the 
two 
educational 
therapy 
groups 
combined. 
Any 
number 
of 
DVs 
may 
be 
used; 
the 
procedure 
deals 
with 
correlations 
among 
them, 
and 
the 
entire 
analysis 
is  accomplished 
within 
the 
preset 
level 
for 
Type 
I error. 
Once 
reliable 
differences 
are 
found, 
techniques 
are 
available 
to 
assess 
which 
DVs 
are 
influenced 
by 
which 
IV. 
For 
example, 
assignment 
to 
treatment 
group 
might affect 
the 
academic 
DV 
but 
not 
attention 
span. 
MANOVA 
is 
also 
available 
when 
there 
are 
within-subject 
IVs. 
For 
example, 
children 
might 
be 
measured 
on 
both 
DVs 
three times: 
3,6, 
and 
9 months 
after 
therapy 
begins. 
MANOVA 
is 
discussed 
in 
Chapter 
9 and 
a special case 
of 
it (profile 
analysis. 
in 
which 
the 
within-subjects 
IV 
is  treat 
multi­
variately) 
in 
Chapter 
10. 
Profile 
analysis 
also 
is 
an 
alternative 
to 
one-way 
between-subjects 
MANOVA 
when 
the 
DVs 
are 
all 
measured 
on 
the 
same 
scale. 
Discriminant 
function 
analysis 
is  also 
available 
for 
one-way 
between-subjects 
designs, 
as 
described 
in 
Section 
2.1.3.1 
and 
Chapter 
11. 
2.1.2.7 
One-Way 
MANCOVA 
:...--
s 
In 
addition 
to 
dealing 
with 
multiple 
DVs, 
multivariate 
analysis 
of 
variance 
can be 
applied 
to 
prob­
lems 
when 
there 
are 
one 
or 
more 
covariates. 
In 
this 
case, 
MANOVA 
becomes 
multivariate 
analysis 
of 
covariance-MANCOVA. 
In 
the 
educational 
therapy 
example 
of 
Section 
2.1.2.6, 
it  might 
be 
worthwhile 
to 
adjust 
the 
DV 
scores 
for 
pretreatment 
differences 
in academic 
achievement 
and 
atten­
tion 
span. 
Here 
the 
covariates 
are 
pretests 
of 
the 
DV
s, 
a  classic 
use 
of 
covariance 
analysis. 
After 
adjustment 
for 
pretreatment 
scores, 
differences 
in 
posttest 
scores 
(DVs) 
can be 
more 
clearly 
attrib­
uted 
to 
treatment 
(the 
two 
types 
of 
educational 
therapy 
plus 
control 
group 
that 
make 
up 
the 
IV). 
In 
the 
one-way 
ANCOVA 
example 
of 
religious 
groups 
in 
Section 
2.1.2.2, 
it might 
be 
interest­
ing 
to 
test 
political 
liberalism 
versus 
conservatism, 
and 
attitude 
toward 
ecology, 
as 
well 
as 
attitude 
toward 
abortion, 
to 
create 
three 
DV
s. 
Here 
again, 
differences 
in 
attitudes 
might 
be 
associated 
with 
both 
differences 
in 
religion 
and 
differences 
in 
education 
(which, 
in 
tum, 
varies 
with 
religious 
affili­
ation). 
In 
the 
context 
of 
MANCOVA, 
education 
is  the 
covariate, 
religious 
affiliation 
the 
IV, 
and 
atti­
tudes 
the 
DV
s. 
Differences 
in attitudes 
among 
groups 
with 
different 
religious 
affiliation 
are 
assessed 
after 
adjustment 
for 
differences 
in education. 
If
the 
IV 
has 
more 
than 
two 
levels, 
planned 
and 
post 
hoc 
comparisons 
are 
useful, 
with 
adjust­
ment 
for 
covariates. 
MANCOVA 
(Chapter 
9) 
is  available 
for 
both 
the 
main 
analysis 
and 
comparisons. 
2.1.2.8 
Factorial 
MANOVA 
Factorial 
MANOVA 
is 
the 
extension 
of 
MANOVA 
to 
designs 
with 
more 
than 
one 
IV 
and 
multiple 
DVs. 
For 
example, 
gender 
(a 
between-subjects 
IV) 
might 
be 
added 
to 
type 
of 
educational 
therapy 
(another 
between-subjects 
IV) 
with 
both 
academic 
achievement 
and 
attention 
span 
used 
as 
DVs.

2.3 
Technique 
Chapters 
Chapters 
5 through 
16, 
the 
basic 
technique 
chapters, 
follow 
a common 
format. 
First, 
the 
technique 
is 
described 
and 
the 
general 
purpose 
briefly 
discussed. 
Then 
the 
specific 
kinds 
of 
questions 
that 
can 
be 
answered 
through 
application 
of 
that 
technique 
are 
listed. 
Next, 
both 
the 
theoretical 
and 
practical 
limitations 
of 
the 
technique 
are 
discussed; 
this 
section 
lists 
assumptions 
particularly 
associated 
with 
the 
technique, 
describes 
methods 
for 
checking 
the 
assumptions 
for 
your 
data 
set, 
and 
gives 
sugges­
tions 
for 
dealing 
with 
violations. 
Then 
a small 
hypothetical 
data 
set 
is used 
to 
illustrate 
the 
statistical 
development 
of 
the 
procedure. 
It 
is recommended 
that 
students 
follow 
the 
matrix 
calculations 
using 
a matrix 
algebra 
program 
available 
in 
the 
three 
statistical 
computer 
packages 
or 
a spreadsheet 
pro­
gram 
such 
as 
Excel 
or 
Quattro. 
Simple 
analyses 
by 
programs 
from 
three 
computer 
packages follow. 
The 
next 
section 
describes 
the 
major 
types 
of 
the 
technique, 
when 
appropriate. 
Then 
some 
of 
the 
most 
important 
issues 
to 
be 
considered 
when 
using 
the 
technique 
are 
covered, 
including 
special 
statistical 
tests, 
data 
snooping, 
and 
the 
like. 
30 
C H A 
PTE
R   2 
The 
next 
section 
shows 
a step-by-step 
application 
of 
the 
technique 
to 
actual 
data 
gathered, 
as 
described 
in 
Appendix 
B. 
Assumptions 
are 
tested 
and 
violations 
dealt 
with, 
when 
necessary. 
Major 
hypotheses 
are 
evaluated, 
and 
follow-up analyses 
are 
performed 
as 
indicated. 
Then 
a Results 
section 
is  developed, 
as 
might 
be 
appropriate 
for 
submission 
to 
a professional 
journal. 
When 
more 
than 
one 
major 
type 
of 
technique 
is  available, 
there 
are 
additional 
complete 
examples using 
real 
data. 
Finally, 
a detailed 
comparison 
of 
features 
available 
in 
the 
SPSS, 
SAS, 
and 
SYSTAT 
programs 
is  made. 
In 
working 
with 
these 
technique 
chapters, 
it is  suggested 
that 
the 
student/researcher 
apply 
the 
various 
analyses 
to 
some 
interesting 
large 
data 
set. 
Many 
data 
banks 
are 
readily 
accessible 
through 
computer 
installations. 
Further, 
although 
we 
recommend 
methods 
of
reporting 
multivariate 
results, 
it may be 
inappro­
priate 
to 
report 
them 
fully 
in 
all 
publications. 
Certainly, 
one 
would 
at least 
want 
to 
mention 
that 
uni­
variate 
results 
were 
supported 
and 
guided 
by 
multivariate 
inference. 
But 
the 
details 
associated 
with 
a full 
disclosure 
of 
multivariate 
results 
at 
a  colloquium, 
for 
instance, 
might 
require 
more 
attention 
than 
one 
could 
reasonably 
expect 
from 
an 
audience. 
Likewise, 
a full 
multivariate 
analysis 
may 
be 
more 
than 
some 
journals 
are 
willing 
to 
print. 
2.4 
Preliminary 
Check 
of 
the 
Data 
Before 
applying 
any 
technique, 
or 
sometimes 
even 
before 
choosing 
a  technique, 
you 
should 
deter­
mine 
the 
fit 
between 
your 
data 
and 
some 
very 
basic 
assumptions 
underlying 
most 
of 
the 
multivariate 
statistics. 
Though 
each 
technique 
has 
specific 
assumptions 
as 
well, 
most 
require 
consideration 
of 
material 
in 
Chapter 
4.
