bac genes for recombinant bacilysin and anticapsin production in Bacillus host strains.
The genes encoding the biosynthesis of the dipeptide bacilysin and its antibiotic constituent anticapsin were isolated from several strains of Bacillus subtilis as well as B. amyloliquefaciens and B. pumilus. The ywfBCDEF genes of B. subtilis 168 were shown to carry the biosynthetic core functions and were renamed bacABCDE. Mutation of the bacD gene or transformation of the bacABC genes into a B. subtilis Delta (ywfA-bacABCDE) deletion mutant led to the accumulation of anticapsin, which was fourfold higher after transformation of the bacABC genes into a bacD mutant. The genes bacD and bacE proved to encode the functions of amino acid ligation and self-protection to bacilysin, respectively. Amplification of the bacABCDE gene cluster in a bacAB gene-deficient host strain of B. amyloliquefaciens resulted in a tenfold bacilysin overproduction. Some host strains required distinct glucosamine and yeast extract supplements in order to prevent suicidal effects of the recombinant antibiotic production. The bac genes from different Bacillus species revealed the same arrangement and 72.6-88.6% of sequence identity.
