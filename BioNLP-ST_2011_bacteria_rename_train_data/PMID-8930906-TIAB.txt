System to study horizontal gene exchange among microorganisms without cultivation of recipients.
Ribosomal RNA genes are characterized by highly conserved sequences and are present in multiple copies in most prokaryotic chromosomes. In principle, therefore, they might serve as sites for homologous recombination between unrelated microorganisms. Plasmids containing 23S ribosomal gene sequences, from different bacteria, which had been interrupted by insertion of a kanamycin-resistance gene, were used to transform Acinetobacter sp. DSM587 (former name: Acinetobacter calcoaceticus BD413-ivl10). In all cases, homologies between the 23S rRNA genes of phylogenetically distant bacteria and Acinetobacter sp. DSM587 were sufficient for replacement recombination events. The integration events, resulting in inactivation of any one of the seven rrn operons of Acinetobacter sp. DSM587, had no observable influence on cell growth. These results suggest the possibility of rRNA genes serving as natural vehicles for horizontal gene transfer. They also provide the basis of a novel strategy to analyse gene transfer without selection or cultivation of recipient cells. Because of the highly conserved structure of bacterial rrn operons, recombination events subsequent to gene transfer can be readily identified by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the recombinant sequence using a universal forward primer for the 16S rRNA gene and a reverse primer specific for the integrated marker gene.
