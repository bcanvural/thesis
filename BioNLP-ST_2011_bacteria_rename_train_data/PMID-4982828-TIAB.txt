Temperature-sensitive induction of bacteriophage in Bacillus subtilis 168.
In a temperature-sensitive mutant of Bacillus subtilis 168, induction of the defective phage PBSX occurred at 48 C. Cell lysis began after 90 min of growth at 48 C, and cell viability began to decrease after 10 to 30 min. The loss in viability at the nonpermissive temperature was prevented by azide or cyanide. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), ribonucleic acid, and protein synthesis were not inhibited at 48 C. Temperature induction of the temperate phage SPO2 also occurred in this mutant. The temperature-sensitive mutation, designated tsi-23, was linked by transduction to purB6 and pig, the order being purB6 pig tsi-23. Mutation tsi-23 was transformable to wild type by B. subtilis 168 DNA but not by DNA from the closely related strains W23 or S31. DNA from the latter two strains transformed auxotrophic markers of strain 168 at frequencies close to those found with 168 donor DNA. Upon temperature induction, cellular DNA was broken to a size of 22S, characteristic of DNA in PBSX particles. The DNA isolated from temperature-induced PBSX did not give an increased Ade(+)/Met(+) transformant ratio relative to cellular DNA nor contain preferential break points as determined by transformation of four closely linked markers.
