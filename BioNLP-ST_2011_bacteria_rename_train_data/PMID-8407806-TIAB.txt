Cloning and nucleotide sequence of a plasmid-carried gene coding for a minor small, acid-soluble protein from Bacillus megaterium spores.
The gene (termed sspG) coding for a small, acid-soluble protein (SASP) from spores of Bacillus megaterium QMB1551, termed SASP-G, has been cloned, and its nucleotide sequence has been determined. SASP-G is a 42-residue protein containing 2 tryptophan and 11 lysine residues, including a hexalysine sequence, and is not homologous to any previously described SASP. The sspG gene appears to be an additional member of the sigma G regulon. No gene homologous to sspG is present in B. cereus T or B. subtilis 168. The reason for the absence of sspG from other Bacillus species appears to be that in B. megaterium, sspG is present only on a 111-kb plasmid; this plasmid is not present in B. cereus T or B. subtilis 168. The sspG gene is the first forespore-expressed gene found to be on a plasmid.
