Determination of a 12 kb nucleotide sequence around the 76 degrees region of the Bacillus subtilis chromosome.
The nucleotide sequence of a 12361 bp DNA segment in the 76 degrees region of the Bacillus subtilis chromosome has been determined. Ten putative ORFs were identified. The deduced amino acid sequences of the products of two of them (glv-1 and glv-2) exhibited high similarity to those of glvG (6-phospho-beta-glucosidase gene) and glvC [permease (the IIC domain) of the phosphotransferase system (PTS)], respectively, in the glv operon of Escherichia coli. The C-terminal region of Glv-2 exhibited similarity to the entire region of GlvB (the IIB domain of PTS) of E. coli, suggesting fusion of the glvC and glvB genes in B. subtilis. glv-1, yfiA and glv-2 seem to form an operon of a phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar PTS, followed by a presumed four-membered operon of an ABC transport system. Moreover, a presumed sugar symporter and its regulatory genes were located in this region.
