rpoD operon promoter used by sigma H-RNA polymerase in Bacillus subtilis.
Three promoters direct transcription of the sigA (rpoD) operon in Bacillus subtilis. Promoters P1 and P2 are used during the exponential growth phase, whereas P3 is used only during the stationary phase. We examined the use of these promoters in promoter-probe plasmids and found that expression from P3 was prevented by a mutation in spoOH, which encodes the secondary RNA polymerase sigma factor sigma H. Moreover, we found that sigma H-containing RNA polymerase efficiently and accurately used the P3 promoter in vitro. Evidently, this operon, which is essential for exponential growth, is transcribed during the early phase of sporulation by this secondary form of RNA polymerase. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of the P3 promoter and the spoVG promoter, which also is used by sigma H-RNA polymerase, revealed sequences at the -10 and -35 regions of these promoters that may signal recognition of promoters by sigma H-RNA polymerase.
