The Obg subfamily of bacterial GTP-binding proteins: essential proteins of largely unknown functions that are evolutionarily conserved from bacteria to humans.
Members of the Obg subfamily of small GTP-binding proteins (called Obg, CgtA, ObgE or YhbZ in different bacterial species) have been found in various prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, ranging from bacteria to humans. Although serious changes in phenotypes are observed in mutant bacteria devoid of Obg or its homologues, specific roles of these GTP-binding proteins remain largely unknown. Recent genetic and biochemical studies, as well as determination of the structures of Obg proteins from Bacillus subtilis and Thermus thermophilus, shed new light on the possible functions of the members of the Obg subfamily and may constitute a starting point for the elucidation of their exact biological role.
