A new defective phage containing a randomly selected 8 kilobase-pairs fragment of host chromosomal DNA inducible in a strain of Bacillus natto.
A new defective phage, designated PBND8, was induced in Bacillus natto strain IAM1207 with bleomycin and mitomycin C. PBND8 particles contained a randomly selected 8 kilobase-pairs (kbp) fragment of the host chromosomal DNA. Electron microscopy showed that PBND8 has a small head with a complex tail structure like PBSX, a defective phage of Bacillus subtilis 168. The PBND8 head, however, is clearly smaller than that of PBSX which contains 13-kbp fragments of the host chromosomal DNA. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis revealed that the structural proteins of PBND8 are distinct from those of PBSX and PBSY (PBSZ) of B. subtilis W23. PBND8 exhibited a bacteriocin-like killing activity to the other Bacillus cells.
