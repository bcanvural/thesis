Structural and functional relationships between fumarase and aspartase.
Nucleotide sequences of the fumarase (fumC) and aspartase (aspA) genes of Escherichia coli K12. The nucleotide sequences of two segments of DNA (2250 and 2921 base-pairs) containing the functionally related fumarase (fumC) and aspartase (aspA) genes of Escherichia coli K12 were determined. The fumC structural gene comprises 1398 base-pairs (466 codons, excluding the initiation codon), and it encodes a polypeptide of Mr 50353 that resembles the fumarases of Bacillus subtilis 168 (citG-gene product), rat liver and pig heart. The fumC gene starts 140 base-pairs downstream of the structurally-unrelated fumA gene, but there is no evidence that both genes form part of the same operon. The aspA structural gene comprises 1431 base-pairs (477 codons excluding the initiation codon), and it encodes a polypeptide of Mr 52190, similar to that predicted from maxicell studies and for the enzyme from E. coli W. Remarkable homologies were found between the primary structures of the fumarase (fumC and citG) and aspartase (aspA) genes and their products, suggesting close structural and evolutionary relationships.
