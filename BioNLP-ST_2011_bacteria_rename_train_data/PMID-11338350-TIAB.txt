[Cold shock in bacteria] Various species and genera of bacterial show the same responses to low temperature.
Cold induces cold shock genes, by causing significant changes in the regulation of protein synthesis. The synthesis of major proteins in the microbial cell is suppressed. However, there is synthesis of a great deal of new proteins, the so-called cold shock ones. The chief protein in this family is E. coli CspA that activates the translation of other cold shock genes and negatively regulates the expression of its own gene. E. coli CspA homologies were identified in many bacteria. They can be also identified in other microorganisms, including the pathogens of infectious diseases. This can be attributable to the presence of common antigens in different bacteria. The data presented should be borne in mind in identifying bacteria and in designing immunodiagnostic agents if there is a culture cooling stage in their technology.
