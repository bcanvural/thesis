Lagging-strand origins of the promiscuous plasmid pMV158: physical and functional characterization.
The streptococcal plasmid pMV158 replicates by a rolling circle mechanism, which involves the generation of single-stranded plasmid DNA intermediates. This plasmid has the unique feature of having two lagging-strand origins of replication. One of these origins, termed ssoU, is functional in Streptococcus pneumoniae and in Bacillus subtilis in an orientation-dependent manner. The other origin, ssoA, is only functional in the former host. RNA polymerase seems to be involved in the initiation of the conversion of single- to double-stranded plasmid DNA from both ssoA and ssoU. Mutational and deletion analyses have allowed us to define ssoA as being within a highly structured, non-coding 199 bp region. Within this region, two elements which are conserved in several rolling-circle replicating plasmids are located, the recombination site RSB and a 6 base consensus sequence. Both elements may play a role in the conversion of single- to double-stranded plasmid DNA.
