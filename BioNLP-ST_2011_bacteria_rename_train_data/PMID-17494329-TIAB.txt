[Comparative investigation of fructosobisphosphatases of Bacillus subtilis and pale-green dwarfism pathogens of cereals in the reaction of double diffusion in gel according to Ouchterlony] Serological properties of fructosobisphosphatases (FBPases) of Bacillus subtilis 668 and PGD agent of cereals--the mollicute Acholplasma laidlawii var. granulum st. 118 (Alg 118) were studied in a comparative aspect with the help of the reaction of double diffusion in gel according to Ouchterlony. It was established for each of microorganisms that their extracellular and intracellular enzymes are similar in serologic respect, and each of them is composed of two antigens, one of them being identical in the both microorganisms, while the other displays only partial identity, since it reacts with antibodies in heterological systems with formation of a precipitation line looking as a "spur". That indicates to the fact that antisera to those enzymes contain antibodies both to general determinants of antigens which are compared (FBPases here), and to the determinant absent in one of them. Basing on the investigation results it is concluded that FBPase of B. subtilis is rather similar than identical, in serological aspect, to the enzyme Alg 118 of the same name.
