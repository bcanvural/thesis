A cluster of nine tRNA genes between ribosomal gene operons in Bacillus subtilis.
A cluster of nine tRNA genes located in the 1-kb region between ribosomal operons rrnJ and rrnW in Bacillus subtilis has been cloned and sequenced. This cluster contains the genes for tRNA(UACVal), tRNA(UGUThr), tRNA(UUULys), tRNA(UAGLeu). tRNA(GCCGly), tRNA(UAALeu), tRNA(ACGArg), tRNA(UGGPro), and tRNA(UGCAla). The newly discovered tRNA gene cluster combines features of the 3'-end of trnI, a cluster of 6 tRNA genes between ribosomal operons rrnI and rrnH, and of the 5'-end of trnB, a cluster of 21 tRNA genes found immediately 3' to rrnB. Neither the tRNA(UAGLeu) gene nor its product has been found previously in B. subtilis. With the discovery of this new set of tRNA genes, a total of 60 such genes have now been found in B. subtilis. These known genes account for almost all of the tRNA hybridizing restriction fragments of the B. subtilis genome. The 60 known tRNA genes of B. subtilis code for only 28 different anticodons, compared with a total of 41 different anticodons for 78 tRNA genes in Escherichia coli. This may indicate that B. subtilis does not need as many anticodons because of more flexible translation rules, similar to the situation in Mycoplasma capricolum.
