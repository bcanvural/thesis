Cloning of sporulation genes spo0A and spo0C of Bacillus subtilis onto rho 11 temperate bacteriophage.
A HindIII fragment harboring the intact spo0C gene of Bacillus subtilis was cloned with rho 11 temperate bacteriophage as a vector. Transformation experiments with the DNA from rho 11 dspo0C+ specialized transducing phage showed that the spo0C gene resides on a 5.3-megadalton fragment generated by HindIII digestion. The 5.3-megadalton fragment also contains the intact spo0A gene, but not spoIIIA, spoIIIB, or spoIVB.
