The nucleotide sequence of the rodC operon of Bacillus subtilis.
The rodC1 mutation of Bacillus subtilis is a temperature-sensitive marker which affects the levels of teichoic acid synthesis and the cellular morphology. We have determined the nucleotide sequence of the bicistronic operon which contains the rodC gene and the nucleotide sequence of the rodC1 mutant allele. The temperature-sensitive phenotype of the rodC mutant is the result of a single base-pair change. A cytosine to thymine transition in the non-coding strand results in the replacement of a serine residue in the wild-type protein with a phenylalanine residue in the mutant protein. The other gene in the operon, the rodD gene, appears to be equivalent to the gtaA gene which encodes uridine diphosphate-glucose poly-(glycerol phosphate) alpha-glucosyl transferase, an enzyme involved in techoic acid synthesis. This is the first nucleotide sequence analysis of both the wild-type and mutant alleles of a morphogene in B. subtilis.
