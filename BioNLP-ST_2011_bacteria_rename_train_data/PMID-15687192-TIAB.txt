A polysaccharide deacetylase homologue, PdaA, in Bacillus subtilis acts as an N-acetylmuramic acid deacetylase in vitro.
A polysaccharide deacetylase homologue, PdaA, was determined to act as an N-acetylmuramic acid deacetylase in vitro. Histidine-tagged truncated PdaA (with the putative signal sequence removed) was overexpressed in Escherichia coli cells and purified. Measurement of deacetylase activity showed that PdaA could deacetylate peptidoglycan treated with N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase CwlH but could not deacetylate peptidoglycan treated with or without DL-endopeptidase LytF (CwlE). Reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (MS) and MS-MS analyses indicated that PdaA could deacetylate the N-acetylmuramic acid residues of purified glycan strands derived from Bacillus subtilis peptidoglycan.
