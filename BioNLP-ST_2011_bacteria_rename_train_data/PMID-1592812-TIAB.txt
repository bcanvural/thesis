Roles of rpoD, spoIIF, spoIIJ, spoIIN, and sin in regulation of Bacillus subtilis stage II sporulation-specific transcription.
Bacillus subtilis strains containing defects in the sporulation gene spoIIF (kinA), spoIIJ (kinA), or spoIIN (ftsA) cannot transcribe the sigma E-dependent gene spoIID. Results presented here and by other workers demonstrate that the spoIIF, spoIIJ, and spoIIN gene products control spoIID transcription indirectly by coordinating the induction of the spoIIGAB, spoIIE, and spoIIAC operons, which are required for sigma E synthesis and processing. Sporulation competence and spoIIGAB, spoIIE, and spoIIAC transcription were restored in spoIIF, spoIIJ, and spoIIN mutants by introduction of crsA47, a mutation in the major vegetative sigma factor sigma A. crsA mutations are known to restore sporulation in certain spo0 mutants. crsA suppression of kinA and ftsA mutations was achieved through inhibition of the transcription of sin, a gene involved in the selection between several post-exponential-phase cell states. A deletion of sin restored sporulation competence in spoIIF, spoIIJ, or spoIIN mutant strains. A sin deletion was also able to restore sporulation competence in the crsA suppressible stage 0 mutant spo0K141.
