Metabolism of isoeugenol via isoeugenol-diol by a newly isolated strain of Bacillus subtilis HS8.
A bacterium designated as HS8 was newly isolated from soil based on its ability to degrade isoeugenol. The strain was identified as Bacillus subtilis according to its 16S rDNA sequence analysis and biochemical characteristics. The metabolic pathway for the degradation of isoeugenol was examined. Isoeugenol-diol, for the first time, was detected as an intermediate from isoeugenol to vanillin by a bacterial strain. Isoeugenol was converted to vanillin via isoeugenol-diol, and vanillin was then metabolized via vanillic acid to guaiacol by strain HS8. These metabolites, vanillin, vanillic acid, and guaiacol, are all valuable aromatic compounds in flavor production. At the same time, the bipolymerization of isoeugenol was observed, which produced dehydrodiisoeugenol and decreased the vanillin yield. High level of vanillic acid decarboxylase activity was detected in cell-free extract. These findings provided a detailed profile of isoeugenol metabolism by a B. subtilis strain for the first time, which would improve the production of valuable aromatic compounds by biotechnology.
