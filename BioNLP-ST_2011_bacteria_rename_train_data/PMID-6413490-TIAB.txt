Genes controlling xylan utilization by Bacillus subtilis.
Eight mutants of Bacillus subtilis deficient in xylan utilization were isolated and characterized genetically and biochemically. Each mutant was obtained independently after nitrosoguanidine mutagenesis. All of the analyzed mutations were shown to be linked. Reciprocal transformation crosses revealed the existence of two genes controlling xylan utilization which have been designated xynA and xynB. Available data have indicated that these two genes code for two xylan-degrading enzymes existing in the wild-type strains, an extracellular beta-xylanase (xynA) and a cell-associated beta-xylosidase (xynB).
