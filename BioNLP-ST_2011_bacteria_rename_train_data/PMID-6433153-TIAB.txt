Functional substitution of the recE gene of Bacillus subtilis by the recA gene of Proteus mirabilis.
Rec mutants of Bacillus subtilis have been tested for complementation by the recA gene of Proteus mirabilis (recApm) which was introduced into B. subtilis via the plasmid pHP334. In the recE4 mutant of B. subtilis the plasmid pHP334 restored significantly the defects in RecE functions tested: UV-sensitivity, homologous recombination (transduction and transformation) and prophage induction. Although serological methods to detect the presence of RecApm protein in B. subtilis have been unsuccessful, our results strongly indicate that the recE function of B. subtilis is analogous to the recA function of P. mirabilis.
