Genetics of leucine biosynthesis in Bacillus megaterium QM B1551.
Genes involved in the biosynthesis of leucine have been mapped in Bacillus megaterium QM B1551, using transducing phage MP13. Mutations were designated leuA, leuB, or leuC on the basis of enzyme assays. Two mutant strains were deficient in the enzyme activities of leuA (alpha-isopropylmalate synthase) and leuC (beta-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase) and so may contain polar mutations. Fine-structure transduction mapping established the gene order leuC-leuB-leuA-ilv-hem-phe. The orientation of the leu genes to the ilv gene is the same as in Bacillus subtilis, but the relationship in respect to two other linked markers, hem and phe, differs.
