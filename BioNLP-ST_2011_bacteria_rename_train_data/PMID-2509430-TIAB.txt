Characterization of the gene for a protein kinase which phosphorylates the sporulation-regulatory proteins Spo0A and Spo0F of Bacillus subtilis.
The kinA (spoIIJ) locus contains a single gene which codes for a protein of 69,170 daltons showing strong homology to the transmitter kinases of two component regulatory systems. The purified kinase autophosphorylates in the presence of ATP and mediates the transfer of phosphate to the Spo0A and Spo0F sporulation regulatory proteins. Spo0F protein was a much better phosphoreceptor for this kinase than Spo0A protein in vitro. Mutants with deletion mutations in the kinA gene were delayed in their sporulation. They produced about a third as many spores as the wild type in 24 h, but after 72 h on solid medium, the level of spores approximated that found for the wild-type strain. Such mutations had no effect on the regulation of the abrB gene or on the timing of subtilisin expression and therefore did not impair the repression function of the Spo0A protein. Placement of the kinA locus on a multicopy vector suppressed the sporulation-defective phenotype of spo0B, spo0E, and spo0F mutations but not of spo0A mutations. The results suggest that the spo0B-, spo0E-, and spo0F-dependent pathway of activation (phosphorylation) of the Spo0A regulator may be by-passed through the kinA gene product if it is present at sufficiently high intracellular concentration. The results suggest that multiple kinases exist for the Spo0A protein.
