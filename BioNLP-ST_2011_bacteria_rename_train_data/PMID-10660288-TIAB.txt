RNA-binding proteins: TRAPping RNA bases.
In Bacillus subtilis, tryptophan biosynthesis is regulated by a mechanism called attenuation. The new crystal structure of the 'trp RNA binding attenuation protein', TRAP, in complex with RNA has provided new structural insights into how proteins can bind RNA to regulate transcription and translation.
