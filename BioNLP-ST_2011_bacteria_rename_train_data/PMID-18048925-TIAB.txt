CsoR regulates the copper efflux operon copZA in Bacillus subtilis.
The adaptation of Bacillus subtilis to elevated levels of copper ions requires the copper-inducible copZA operon encoding a copper chaperone and efflux ATPase. Here we identify CsoR (formerly YvgZ) as the copper-sensing repressor that regulates the copZA operon. CsoR binds with high affinity to an operator site overlapping the copZA promoter and its binding is specifically inhibited by copper salts. As previously described, the YhdQ (CueR) protein also binds to the copZA regulatory region, but genetic experiments indicate that this protein is not responsible for the copper-dependent regulation of this operon.
