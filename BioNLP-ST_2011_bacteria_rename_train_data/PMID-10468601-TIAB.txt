An enhancer element located downstream of the major glutamate dehydrogenase gene of Bacillus subtilis.
The rocG gene of Bacillus subtilis, encoding a catabolic glutamate dehydrogenase, is transcribed by SigL (sigma(54))-containing RNA polymerase and requires for its expression RocR, a member of the NtrC/NifA family of proteins that bind to enhancer-like elements, called upstream activating sequences (UAS). Unlike the case for other sigma(54)-dependent genes, rocG has no UAS; instead, its expression depends on a sequence located 1.5 kilobases downstream of the rocG promoter, beyond the end of the rocG coding region. The same sequence also serves as the UAS for the downstream rocABC operon and can activate rocG if moved upstream of its promoter. Furthermore, the activating sequence can be moved as far as 15 kilobases downstream of the rocG promoter and still retain partial activity.
