Expression of ykdA, encoding a Bacillus subtilis homologue of HtrA, is heat shock inducible and negatively autoregulated.
There are three members of the HtrA family of serine proteases, YkdA, YvtA, and YyxA, encoded in the chromosome of Bacillus subtilis. In this study, we report on the promoter structure and regulation of ykdA expression. The ykdA gene is heat inducible, exhibiting a biphasic pattern of expression during a 60-min interval after heat shock. Increased expression after heat shock occurs at the transcriptional level. The heat-shock-inducible promoter has a single mismatch with a SigA-type -10 motif, but does not exhibit similarity to a SigA -35 region. There are six octamer repeats with a consensus TTTTCACA positioned at, and upstream of, the normal position of a -35 region. While repeats V and VI appear dispensable, repeat IV is essential for normal thermoinducible expression. This promoter structure is also found in the control region of yvtA, encoding a second member of this family of proteases. Expression of ykdA is negatively autoregulated both during the growth cycle and during heat shock. Our evidence suggests that YkdA protease activity is not required for this form of regulation. Null mutants of ykdA display increased tolerance to heat and are 80-fold more resistant to 10 mM hydrogen peroxide than wild-type cells. However, ykdA expression is not induced by hydrogen peroxide. These results indicate that the regulon to which YkdA belongs is linked to the oxidative stress response in B. subtilis.
