Organization and regulation of an operon that encodes a sporulation-essential sigma factor in Bacillus subtilis.
Deletion of sigE, the structural gene for the sporulation-induced RNA polymerase sigma factor, sigma E, prevented endospore formation by Bacillus subtilis. The effects of integration of plasmids into the sigE region of the chromosome and the use of complementation analyses demonstrated that sigE is part of an operon that includes a promoter-proximal gene, spoIIGA, that is essential for sporulation. Gene fusions to the promoter of this operon, spoIIG, demonstrated that transcription from this promoter is induced at the beginning of sporulation and is dependent on several spoO genes.
