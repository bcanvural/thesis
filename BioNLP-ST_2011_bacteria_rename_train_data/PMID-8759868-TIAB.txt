Identification of a novel gene of pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis, pyrDII, that is required for dihydroorotate dehydrogenase activity in Bacillus subtilis.
An in-frame deletion in the coding region of a gene of previously unidentified function (which is called orf2 and which we propose to rename pyrDII) in the Bacillus subtilis pyr operon led to pyrimidine bradytrophy, markedly reduced dihydroorotate dehydrogenase activity, and derepressed levels of other enzymes of pyrimidine biosynthesis. The deletion mutation was not corrected by a plasmid encoding pyrDI, the previously identified gene encoding dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, but was complemented by a plasmid encoding pyrDII. We propose that pyrDII encodes a protein subunit of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase that catalyzes electron transfer from the pyrDI-encoded subunit to components of the electron transport chain.
