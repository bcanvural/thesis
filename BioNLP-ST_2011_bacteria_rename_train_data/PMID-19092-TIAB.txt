Presence of a third sucrose hydrolyzing enzyme in Bacillus subtilis: constitutive levanase synthesis by mutants of Bacillus subtilis Marburg 168.
A beta-D-fructofuranosidase -- called levanase -- capable of the hydrolysis of sucrose, inulin and levans has been identified in Bacillus subtilis Marburg. This enzyme can not be detected in strain 168. However, sacL mutations -- mapped on the chromosome of strain 168 between the pheA and aroD reference markers -- lead to constitutive levanase synthesis. This synthesis is repressed by carbon sources such as glucose, glycerol or sucrose.
