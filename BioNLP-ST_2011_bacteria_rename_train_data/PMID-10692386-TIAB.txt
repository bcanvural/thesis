Nitrate assimilation genes of the marine diazotrophic, filamentous cyanobacterium Trichodesmium sp. strain WH9601. A 4.0-kb DNA fragment of Trichodesmium sp. strain WH9601 contained gene sequences encoding the nitrate reduction enzymes, nirA and narB. A third gene positioned between nirA and narB encodes a putative membrane protein with similarity to the nitrate permeases of Bacillus subtilis (NasA) and Emericella nidulans (CrnA). The gene was shown to functionally complement a DeltanasA mutant of B. subtilis and was assigned the name napA (nitrate permease). NapA was involved in both nitrate and nitrite uptake by the complemented B. subtilis cells. napA is distinct from the nrt genes that encode the nitrate transporter of freshwater cyanobacteria.
