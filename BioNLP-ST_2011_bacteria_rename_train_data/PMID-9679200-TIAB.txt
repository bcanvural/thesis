An 8 kb nucleotide sequence at the 3' flanking region of the sspC gene (184 degrees) on the Bacillus subtilis 168 chromosome containing an intein and an intron.
As part of the Bacillus subtilis genome sequencing project, we determined the complete nucleotide sequence of an 8000-bp fragment downstream of the sspC gene (184 degrees) of the B. subtilis 168 chromosome. The sequence analysis shows that the sspC gene is located inside of the SP beta region, which differs from the current genetic map of B. subtilis 168. This region contains 12 putative ORFs (yojQ through yojZ and sspC). A homology search for the deduced products of the ORFs shows significant similarities to enzymes involved in deoxyribonucleotide metabolism: ribonucleotide reductase (Nrd) E, NrdF, thioredoxin and dUTPase. Interestingly, this DNA fragment includes two split genes, yojP containing conserved motifs of an intein and yojQ and yojS with an 808-bp intervening sequence for a putative intron structure. In addition, the yojR gene includes a putative new DNA replication terminator.
