A gene at 333 degrees on the Bacillus subtilis chromosome encodes the newly identified sigma B-dependent general stress protein GspA.
In Bacillus subtilis, general stress proteins (Gsps) are induced in response to different stresses (heat, salt, or ethanol) or after nutrient starvation. The majority of the genes for the Gsps are organized in a very large stationary-phase or stress regulon which is controlled by alternative sigma factor sigma B. The most striking spots on Coomassie-stained two-dimensional gels belong to GsiB and GspA, which are synthesized at extremely high levels in response to different stresses. Therefore, we determined the N-terminal protein sequence of GspA, which exhibited total identity to a hypothetical 33.5-kDa protein of B. subtilis encoded by open reading frame 2 (ipa-12d) in the sacY-tyrS1 intergenic region. The GspA-encoding gene gspA and the upstream and downstream regions were cloned with the aid of the PCR technique. By primer extension experiments, one sigma B-dependent promoter immediately upstream of the coding region was identified. A putative factor-independent terminator closely followed the coding region. By Northern (RNA) blot analysis, a 0.95-kb transcript was detected which indicates a monocistronic transcriptional unit. The gspA mRNA was strongly induced by different stimuli like heat or salt stress and starvation for glucose. Analysis of RNA isolated from a sigma B deletion mutant revealed that the transcription of gspA is sigma B dependent. Insertional inactivation of the B. subtilis chromosomal gspA gene confirmed that the gspA gene is not essential for either vegetative growth or growth under the influence of different stresses. In gspA mutant cells, the level of flagellin was increased severalfold over that in wild-type cells.
