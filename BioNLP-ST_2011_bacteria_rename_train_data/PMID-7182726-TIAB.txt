[The in vitro antibacterial values of oxpara liquid, N2 medical liquid and merfen] The disinfectants called Oxpara liquid, N2 medical liquid and merfen are being used in the treatment of pulp and periapical tissue infections in medical dentistry.
In the clinics of H. U. Medical Dentistry Faculty these disinfectants are used in their undiluted, concentrated forms. As it was thought they might be harmful to the tissues in their concentrated forms, it was attempted to find out their least toxic but sufficiently effective dilutions on different bacteria, compared with pheunol. In the light of findings the in vivo values were investigated in another work. The Inhibition Coefficients (IC) for S. aureus were found to be 1/100 in phenol and Oxpara liquid, 1/1000 in Merfen, for S. typhi 1/200 in phenol and N2 medical liquid, 1/2000 in Oxpara liquid and Merfen. The Inferior Lethal Coefficients (ILC) for S. aureus were found to be 1/90 in phenol, 1/80 in phenbol, 1/80 in Oxpara liquid, 1/100 in N2 medical liquid, 1/1400 in Merfen, and for S.typhi 1/100 in phenol and N2 medical liquid and 1/700 in Merfen. The Superior Lethal Coefficients (SLC) for B.subtilis were found to be 1/80 in phenol, in Oxpara and N2 medical liquids, and 1/500 in merfen. When Phenol Coefficients were considered, Oxpara and N2 medical liquids were found to be in equal strength with phenol as antibacterial agents, however Merfen was approximately 15 times stronger than phenol.
