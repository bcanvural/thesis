Essential role of small, acid-soluble spore proteins in resistance of Bacillus subtilis spores to UV light.
Bacillus subtilis strains containing deletions in the genes coding for one or two of the major small, acid-soluble spore proteins (SASP; termed SASP-alpha and SASP-beta) were constructed. These mutants sporulated normally, but the spores lacked either SASP-alpha, SASP-beta, or both proteins. The level of minor SASP did not increase in these mutants, but the level of SASP-alpha increased about twofold in the SASP-beta- mutant, and the level of SASP-beta increased about twofold in the SASP-alpha- mutant. The growth rates of the deletion strains were identical to that of the wild-type strain in rich or poor growth media, as was the initiation of spore germination. However, outgrowth of spores of the SASP-alpha(-)-beta- strain was significantly slower than that of wild-type spores in all media tested. The heat resistance of SASP-beta- spores was identical to that of wild-type spores but slightly greater than that of SASP-alpha- and SASP-alpha(-)-beta- spores. However, the SASP-alpha- and SASP-alpha(-)-beta- spores were much more heat resistant than vegetative cells. The UV light resistances of SASP-beta- and wild-type spores were also identical. However, SASP-alpha(-)-beta- spores were slightly more sensitive to UV light than were log-phase cells of the wild-type or SASP-alpha(-)-beta- strain (the latter have identical UV light resistances); SASP-alpha- spores were slightly more UV light resistant than SASP-alpha(-)-beta- spores. These data strongly implicate SASP, in particular SASP-alpha, in the UV light resistance of B. subtilis spores.
