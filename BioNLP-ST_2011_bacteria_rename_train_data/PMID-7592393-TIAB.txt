Adjacent and divergently oriented operons under the control of the sporulation regulatory protein GerE in Bacillus subtilis.
The DNA-binding protein GerE is the latest-acting regulatory protein in the mother cell line of gene expression during sporulation in Bacillus subtilis. GerE directs the transcription of several genes that encode structural components of the protein coat that encases the mature spore. We report on the identification and characterization of a cluster of additional genes whose transcription is dependent on GerE. These genes, which are located in the replication terminus region of the chromosome (181 degrees on the genetic map), are arranged in adjacent and divergently oriented operons called cgeAB and cgeCDE, which consist of two and at least three genes, respectively. CgeD, the product of the second member of the cgeCDE operon, is strikingly similar to the product of a B. subtilis gene (ipa-63d) of unknown function and is similar at its amino terminus to certain glycosyl transferases involved in polysaccharide biosynthesis. Strains with mutations in the cgeAB and cgeCDE operons produce spores with altered surface properties, on which basis we propose that proteins encoded by these operons influence maturation of the outermost layer of the spore, perhaps by glycosylation of coat proteins at the spore surface.
