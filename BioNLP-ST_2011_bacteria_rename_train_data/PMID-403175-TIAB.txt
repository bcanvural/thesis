Transitory germinative excision repair in Bacillus subtilis.
Bacillus subtilis strains UVSSP-42-1 (hcr42 ssp1) and UVSSP-1-1 (hcr1 ssp1) are ultraviolet (UV) radiation sensitive both as dormant spores and as vegetative cells. These strains are unable to excise cyclobutane-type dimers from the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of irradiated vegetative cells and fail to remove spore photoproduct from the DNA of irradiated spores either by excision (controlled by gene hcr) or by spore repair (controlled by gene ssp1). When irradiated soon after spore germination, these strains excise dimers, but not spore photoproduct, from their DNA. This process, termed germinative excision repair, functions only transiently in the germination phase and is responsible for the high UV resistance of germinated spores and for their temporary capacity to host cell reactivate irradiated phages infecting them. The recA1 mutation confers higher UV sensitivity to the germinated spores, but does not interfere with dimer removal by germinative excision repair.
