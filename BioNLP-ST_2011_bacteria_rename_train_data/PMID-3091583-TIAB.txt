Control of lysogeny and immunity of Bacillus subtilis temperate bacteriophage SP beta by its d gene.
The d gene from the Bacillus subtilis temperate bacteriophage SP beta was isolated. When introduced into an SP beta-sensitive strain of B. subtilis, the cloned d gene directed the synthesis of a 22-kilodalton protein and conferred on the host immunity to SP beta phage. A frameshift mutation, designated d2, was introduced into the cloned d gene, and it was subsequently crossed back into the SP beta phage genome. The resulting SP beta phage grew lytically and formed clear plaques on sensitive bacteria. Although the cloned d gene confers immunity to the host, we could not detect complementation of the d gene by mixed infection with SP beta d2 and various SP beta c mutants. The nucleotide sequence of the 1,033-base-pair PstI-to-EcoRI fragment containing the d gene was determined; it includes an open reading frame that could potentially encode a protein of 227 amino acids. The gene was mapped within the PstI H fragment on the phage genome, which positions the d gene about 25 kilobases from the right end of the phage genome. It is transcribed from right to left.
