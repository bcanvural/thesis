Identification and characterization of the ccdA gene, required for cytochrome c synthesis in Bacillus subtilis.
The gram-positive, endospore-forming bacterium Bacillus subtilis contains several membrane-bound c-type cytochromes. We have isolated a mutant pleiotropically deficient in cytochromes c. The responsible mutation resides in a gene which we have named ccdA (cytochrome c defective). This gene is located at 173 degrees on the B. subtilis chromosome. The ccdA gene was found to be specifically required for synthesis of cytochromes of the c type. CcdA is a predicted 26-kDa integral membrane protein with no clear similarity to any known cytochrome c biogenesis protein but seems to be related to a part of Escherichia coli DipZ/DsbD. The ccdA gene is cotranscribed with two other genes. These genes encode a putative 13.5-kDa single-domain response regulator, similar to B. subtilis CheY and Spo0F, and a predicted 18-kDa hydrophobic protein with no similarity to any protein in databases, respectively. Inactivation of the three genes showed that only ccdA is required for cytochrome c synthesis. The results also demonstrated that cytochromes of the c type are not needed for growth of B. subtilis.
