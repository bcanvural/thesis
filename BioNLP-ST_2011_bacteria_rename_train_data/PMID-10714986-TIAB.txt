Morphogenetic proteins SpoVID and SafA form a complex during assembly of the Bacillus subtilis spore coat.
During endospore formation in Bacillus subtilis, over two dozen polypeptides are assembled into a multilayered structure known as the spore coat, which protects the cortex peptidoglycan (PG) and permits efficient germination. In the initial stages of coat assembly a protein known as CotE forms a ring around the forespore. A second morphogenetic protein, SpoVID, is required for maintenance of the CotE ring during the later stages, when most of proteins are assembled into the coat. Here, we report on a protein that appears to associate with SpoVID during the early stage of coat assembly. This protein, which we call SafA for SpoVID-associated factor A, is encoded by a locus previously known as yrbA. We confirmed the results of a previous study that showed safA mutant spores have defective coats which are missing several proteins. We have extended these studies with the finding that SafA and SpoVID were coimmunoprecipitated by anti-SafA or anti-SpoVID antiserum from whole-cell extracts 3 and 4 h after the onset of sporulation. Therefore, SafA may associate with SpoVID during the early stage of coat assembly. We used immunogold electron microscopy to localize SafA and found it in the cortex, near the interface with the coat in mature spores. SafA appears to have a modular design. The C-terminal region of SafA is similar to those of several inner spore coat proteins. The N-terminal region contains a sequence that is conserved among proteins that associate with the cell wall. This motif in the N-terminal region may target SafA to the PG-containing regions of the developing spore.
