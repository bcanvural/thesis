Thiolation and 2-methylthio- modification of Bacillus subtilis transfer ribonucleic acids.
Six thionucleosides found in Bacillus subtilis transfer ribonucleic acids were investigated: N6-(delta 2-isopentenyl)-2-methylthioadenosine, 5-carboxymethylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine, 4-thiouridine, 2-methylthioadenosine, N-[(9-beta-D-ribofuranosyl-2-methylthiopurin-6-yl)carbamoyl]threonine, and one unknown (X1). The presence of N-[(9-beta-D-ribofuranosyl-2-methylthiopurin-6-yl)carbamoyl]threonine was demonstrated based on the affinity of the transfer ribonucleic acid containing it for an immunoadsorbent made with the antibody directed toward N-[9-(beta-D-ribofuranosyl)purin-6-ylcarbamoyl]-L-threonine. The existance of N-[(9-beta-D-ribofuranosyl-2-methylthiopurin-6-yl)carbamoyl]threonine in two species of lysine transfer ribonucleic acids was also confirmed by high-resolution mass spectrometry. Four of these thionucleosides--N6-(delta 2-isopenenyl)-2-methylthioadenosine, 2-methylthioadenosine, 5-carboxymethylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine, and the unknown designated X1--occurred only in specific areas in the elution profile of an RPC-5 column and probably affect the chromatographic properties of the transfer ribonucleic acids containing them. In contrast with Escherichia coli, where 4-thiouridine is the most frequent type of sulfur-containing modification, approximately one-third of the sulfur groups in B. subtilis transfer ribonucleic acid are present as thiomethyl groups on the 2 position of an adenosine or modified adenosine residue.
