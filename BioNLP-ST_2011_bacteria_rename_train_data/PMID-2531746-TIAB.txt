The organization of the purL gene encoding 5'-phosphoribosylformylglycinamide amidotransferase of Escherichia coli.
Escherichia coli 5'-phosphoribosylformylglycinamide (FGAR) amidotransferase (EC 6.3.5.3) encoded by the purL gene catalyzes the conversion of FGAR to formylglycinamidine in the presence of glutamine and ATP for the de novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis. On the basis of the nucleotide sequence of purL, the enzyme was dissected along the polypeptide chain into at least three discrete regions, designated as domains I, II, and III, by genetic complementation tests. Domain III (255 amino acids), which resides in the C-terminal region, is similar in amido acid sequence to several glutamine amidotransferases and exerts the transfer of the amide nitrogen of glutamine. Domain I (791 amino acids) resides in the N-terminal region and contains a potential ATP binding motif. Domain II (249 amino acids) locates between domains I and III and is composed of an alternating structure of at least eight predicted beta-strand and alpha-helix elements, as has been observed in the family of triosephosphate isomerases. The functions of domains I and II have been discussed in relation to the transfer of the carbonyl oxygen of FGAR into the gamma-phosphorus moiety of ATP. These results support a model that the E. coli purL gene is a fused gene of at least three different gene families. The highly repetitive sequences of the E. coli genome appeared to play an important role in the process of the gene fusion.
