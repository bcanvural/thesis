Characterization of the macromolecular synthesis (MMS) operon from Listeria monocytogenes.
The macromolecular synthesis (MMS) operon consists of three genes: rpsU, which encodes the S21 ribosomal protein in Bacillus subtilis (Bs), rpsU is replaced by orfP23 which encodes a protein of unknown function), dnaG, encoding the DNA primase involved in the initiation of chromosome replication, and rpoD, which encodes the principal sigma subunit of RNA polymerase. The operon was cloned in three segments from Listeria monocytogenes (Lm), initially using a probe designed from a highly conserved region of RpoD. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence revealed three genes: orfP17 (whose product, P17, is homologous to Bs P23), dnaG and rpoD. The Lm DnaG resembles the primase from Escherichia coli through the first two-thirds of the sequence. C-terminal similarity was observed between DnaG from Lm and Bs. Lm RpoD is similar to Bs SigA, shares identical DNA-binding domains with SigA, and is a member of the sigma 43 subgroup of the sigma 70 family.
