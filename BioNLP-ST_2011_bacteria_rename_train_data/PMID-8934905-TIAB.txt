Bacillus vallismortis sp. nov., a close relative of Bacillus subtilis, isolated from soil in Death Valley, California. Five Bacillus strains isolated from Death Valley soil were shown to belong to a previously unidentified species, for which we propose the name Bacillus vallismortis. The type strain is strain DV1-F-3 (= NRRL B-14890). On the basis of previously published restriction digestion data, B. vallismortis is most closely related to Bacillus subtilis. At this time B. vallismortis can be distinguished from B. subtilis only by differences in whole-cell fatty acid compositions, DNA sequences, and levels of reassociation of genomic DNA.
