phoR1, a gene encoding a new histidine protein kinase Myxococcus xanthus.
A soil bacterium able to undergo multicellular development and a coordinated gliding in swarms, requires an accurate regulatory network of phosphorelay proteins. Inorganic phosphate is a limiting nutrient in soil and its importance in regulation is critical. As a step towards studying phosphate regulation and its influence in the developmental process in this bacterium, we screened a Myxococcus xanthus library for clones with phosphatase activity, and found four different ones. The deduced sequence of one of the cloned inserts is similar to that of the classic transmembrane histidine protein kinase of the sensor family of the two-component signal transduction systems with a high sequence similarity to the sensor kinase in the Pho regulon of Bacillus subtilis PhoR. This gene has been named phoR1 and its deduced amino acid sequence consists of 455 residues with a predicted molecular mass of 48.5 kDa. The M. xanthus PhoR1 deduced sequence contains all the characteristic histidine protein kinase motifs in the same order and with the same spacing. A hydropathy profile indicates two membrane-spanning segments located at the extreme N-terminus, according to the putative sensor role of this domain. A gene-disrupted mutant is unable to produce normal mature fruiting bodies and produces fewer spores.
