Organization and function of the YsiA regulon of Bacillus subtilis involved in fatty acid degradation.
The organization and function of the Bacillus subtilis YsiA regulon involved in fatty acid degradation were investigated. Northern and primer extension analyses indicated that this regulon comprises five operons, i.e. lcfA-ysiA-B-etfB-A, ykuF-G, yhfL, yusM-L-K-J, and ywjF-acdA-rpoE. YusJ and AcdA, YsiB and YusL, and YusK presumably encode acyl-CoA dehydrogenases, 3-hydroxyl-CoA dehydrogenase/enoyl-CoA hydratase complexes, and acetyl-CoA C-acyltransferase, respectively, which are directly involved in the fatty acid beta-oxidation cycle. In addition, LcfA and YhfL are likely to encode long chain acyl-CoA ligases. On gel retardation and footprinting analyses involving the purified YsiA protein, we identified cis-sequences for YsiA binding (YsiA boxes) in the promoter regions upstream of ysiA, ykuF, yusL, yhfL, and ywjF, the equilibrium dissociation constants (K(d)) for YsiA binding being 20, 21, 37, 43, and 65 nm, respectively. YsiA binding was specifically inhibited by long chain acyl-CoAs with 14-20 carbon atoms, acyl-CoAs with 18 carbon atoms being more effective; out of long chain acyl-CoAs tested, monounsaturated oleoyl-CoA, and branched chain 12-metyltetradecanoyl-CoA were most effective. These in vitro findings were supported by the in vivo observation that the knock-out of acyl-CoA dehydrogenation through yusJ, etfA, or etfB disruption resulted in YsiA inactivation, probably because of the accumulation of long chain acyl-CoAs in the cells. Furthermore, the disruption of yusL, yusK, yusJ, etfA, etfB, or ykuG affected the utilization of palmitic acid, a representative long chain fatty acid. Based on this work, ysiA, ysiB, ykuF, ykuG, yhfL, yusM, yusL, yusK, yusJ, and ywjF can be renamed fadR, fadB, fadH, fadG, lcfB, fadM, fadN, fadA, fadE, and fadF.
