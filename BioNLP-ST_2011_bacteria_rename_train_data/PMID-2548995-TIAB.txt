Positive regulation of glutamate biosynthesis in Bacillus subtilis.
Nitrogen source regulation of glutamate synthase activity in Bacillus subtilis occurs at the level of transcription of the gltA and gltB genes, which encode the two subunits of the enzyme. We show here that transcription of gltA requires the product of gltC, a gene whose transcription is divergent from that of gltA and whose transcriptional control sequences overlap those of gltA. gltC mutants had decreased, aberrantly regulated levels of glutamate synthase activity and decreased gltA mRNA. The gltC gene product could act in trans to complement both these defects. In addition, the gltC gene product repressed its own transcription. The DNA sequence of gltC revealed that its putative product is very similar to a number of positive regulatory proteins from gram-negative bacteria (the LysR family).
