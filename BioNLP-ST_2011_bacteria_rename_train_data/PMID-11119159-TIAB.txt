Isolation of Bacillus strains from the rhizosphere of cereals and in vitro screening for antagonism against phytopathogenic, food-borne pathogenic and spoilage micro-organisms.
Bacillus strains were isolated from the rhizosphere of cereals in order to be used as natural biocontrol agents (BCAs). They were screened for antagonism in vitro against various test micro-organisms. The isolates showing antagonism were identified to species level. A combination of techniques was employed for the isolation of Bacillus species. Using the direct method, only one of the 25 isolates screened showed antagonistic properties. This strain (IFS-01) was identified by means of API test strips and the ATB Plus computer programme. It proved to be Bacillus subtilis and consequently has been designated as Bacillus subtilis IFS-01. This strain produced either a broad spectrum antimicrobial compound or several compounds with different activities. The fungi and Gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive to the antagonistic isolate than the Gram-negative bacteria. A Bacillus strain producing BCAs which can be used as biopesticides or organic preservatives has been isolated and identified.
