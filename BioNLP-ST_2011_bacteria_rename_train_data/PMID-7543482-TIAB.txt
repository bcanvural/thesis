Effects of spo0 mutations on spo0A promoter switching at the initiation of sporulation in Bacillus subtilis.
Transcriptional analyses of the Bacillus subtilis sporulation initiator gene spo0A revealed that promoter switching from the vegetative (Pv) to the sporulation-specific (Ps) promoter did not occur in the spo0A, spo0B, spo0E, spo0F, and spo0H mutants. The sof-1 mutation in spo0A restored the promoter switching in the spo0F mutant. These results strongly suggest that Spo0A plays a central role in the regulation of its own promoter switching.
