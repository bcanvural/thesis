Identification of Bacillus subtilis adaptive response genes by subtractive differential hybridization.
Subtractive differential hybridization was used to identify genes in Bacillus subtilis that are induced by nutrient limitation. Several transcription units were identified. They exhibited increased transcription when cells were deprived of certain nutrients, such as glucose, ammonium, or phosphate, or when cells were treated with decoyinine. The genes have been designated dci (for decoyinine-inducible) and gsi (for glucose-starvation-inducible). Using lacZ transcriptional fusions, the dependence of dci and gsi expression on gene products of the sensor and activator classes of bacterial two-component regulatory systems was examined. Transcription of dciA was impaired by a mutation in spoOA, while expression of gsiA was dependent on the early competence genes comP and comA. The implications of these findings are discussed, and a provisional scheme for information flow during the transition phase from growth to sporulation is proposed.
