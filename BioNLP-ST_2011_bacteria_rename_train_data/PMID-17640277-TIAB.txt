Bacillus subtilis RecG branch migration translocase is required for DNA repair and chromosomal segregation.
The absence of Bacillus subtilis RecG branch migration translocase causes a defect in cell proliferation, renders cells very sensitive to DNA-damaging agents and increases approximately 150-fold the amount of non-partitioned chromosomes. Inactivation of recF, addA, recH, recV or recU increases both the sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents and the chromosomal segregation defect of recG mutants. Deletion of recS or recN gene partially suppresses cell proliferation, DNA repair and segregation defects of DeltarecG cells, whereas deletion of recA only partially suppresses the segregation defect of DeltarecG cells. Deletion of recG and ripX render cells with very poor viability, extremely sensitive to DNA-damaging agents, and with a drastic segregation defect. After exposure to mitomycin C recG or ripX cells show a drastic defect in chromosome partitioning (approximately 40% of the cells), and this defect is even larger (approximately 60% of the cells) in recG ripX cells. Taken together, these data indicate that: (i) RecG defines a new epistatic group (eta), (ii) RecG is required for proper chromosomal segregation even in the presence of other proteins that process and resolve Holliday junctions, and (iii) different avenues could process Holliday junctions.
