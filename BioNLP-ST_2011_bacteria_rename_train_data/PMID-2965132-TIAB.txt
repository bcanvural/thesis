HPLC quantitation of the six main components of teicoplanin in biological fluids.
Teicoplanin, a new glycopeptide antibiotic belonging to the same class as vancomycin, is a mixture of six main components, designated A3, A2-1, A2-2, A2-3, A2-4 and A2-5. An assay method by higher performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) has been devised to separate and monitor each of these components in blood and urine.
