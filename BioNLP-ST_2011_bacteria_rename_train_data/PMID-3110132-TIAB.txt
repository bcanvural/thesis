prtR enhances the mRNA level of the Bacillus subtilis extracellular proteases.
Studies were performed on the prtR gene which enhances the production of the Bacillus subtilis extracellular proteases and levansucrase, but not the alpha-amylase, RNase, and alkaline phosphatase. To investigate the mode of action of prtR, the Escherichia coli bla gene was placed under the control of two promoters. One was the promoter of the alkaline protease gene (aprE), and the other was the promoter of B. subtilis dihydrofolate reductase gene (dfrA). Expression of the bla gene was enhanced by prtR only when the apr promoter was used. From these results, it was concluded that the apr promoter or its vicinity was the target of prtR and that prtR does not affect the process after transcription. The mRNA levels of aprE and nprE (the neutral protease gene) were significantly increased by prtR, but the half-life of the aprE mRNA was not affected. These results show that the prtR gene product enhances protease production by increasing the rate of transcription initiation.
