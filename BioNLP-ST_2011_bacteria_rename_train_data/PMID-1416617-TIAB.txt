Vector construction, transformation, and gene amplification in Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824.
In order to alter the primary metabolism of C. acetobutylicum, we have constructed E. coli- or B. subtilis-C. acetobutylicum shuttle vectors that could be used to deliver homologous fermentative genes into C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824. The plasmid copy number and plasmid stability in C. acetobutylicum for several of these plasmids were determined. We have also developed a protocol for the electrotransformation of C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824. Difficulty in the transformation of C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 with vectors containing DNA from E. coli plasmids was found to be due to the existence of a restriction system in this strain. This type II restriction endonuclease, named Cac824I, recognizes the sequence 5'-GCNGC-3' and cuts ColE1 plasmids frequently. One of the vectors, pFNK1, possessing a variety of unique cloning sites was used in the amplification of one acid (PTB) and one solvent (AADC) formation gene. The corresponding enzyme activities were amplified in C. acetobutylicum as shown by enzyme assays and SDS-PAGE gels of cell extracts.
