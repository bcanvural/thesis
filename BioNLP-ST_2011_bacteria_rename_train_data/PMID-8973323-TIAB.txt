The Bacillus subtilis chromosome region near 78 degrees contains the genes encoding a new two-component system, three ABC transporters and a lipase.
The nucleotide sequence of a 9444-bp segment around the 78 degrees region of the Bacillus subtilis (Bs) chromosome has been determined. Nine putative orfs were identified. The deduced amino acid sequences of the products of two of them (yfiJ and yfiK) exhibit high similarity to those of a sensor protein, DegS, and a transcriptional regulatory protein, DegU, of Bs, respectively. Three of them (yfiL, yfiM and yfiN) seem to be ABC transporter genes. One orf (designated as lipB), the closest to the sspE among the nine orfs, is the second lipase gene in Bs.
