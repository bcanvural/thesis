[Molecular cloning and structural-functional analysis of the arginine biosynthesis genes of the thermophilic bacterium Bacillus stearothermophilus] Genes encoding arginine biosynthesis of Bacillus stearothermophilus strain 718 were cloned in the mutant argA strain of the Escherichia coli K-12.
The arg genes were shown to be located on the 3.7 kb DNA fragment in the following order: argA--argE--argB. The expression of the argA gene of B. stearothermophilus on the multicopy vehicle is twofold higher in argR- strain of E. coli K-12 than is isogenic argR+ strain. According to hybridization analysis argA genes of B. stearothermophilus and B. subtilis have low level of homology, which is the evidence of their evolutional divergence.
