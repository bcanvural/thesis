Mutant of Bacillus subtilis with a temperature-sensitive autolytic amidase.
A procedure incorporating a petri plate assay for autolysins has been developed for the systematic isolation of mutants with a temperature-sensitive autolytic amidase. We suggest maa as the name for the gene for this enzyme. One such mutant has been characterized as having a heat-sensitive amidase in a variety of studies with both crude autolysin preparations and purified amidase solutions.
