Genetic studies of a secondary RNA polymerase sigma factor in Bacillus subtilis. sigma B (sigma 37) is a secondary species of RNA polymerase sigma factor found in the gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis. To study the function of sigma B genetically, we sought mutations that block the expression of a gene (ctc) known to be transcribed by sigma B-containing RNA polymerase in vitro. One such mutation, called crl, was found to map in or near the structural gene (sigB) for sigma B. To determine directly whether mutations in sigB would prevent transcription of ctc, we replaced sigB in the B. subtilis chromosome with insertion and deletion mutations that disrupted the sigma B coding sequence. Like crl, these in vitro-constructed mutations blocked expression of ctc, but had little or no effect on viability, sporulation, expression of the sporulation gene spoVG, or production of sporulation-associated alkaline protease. Using fusions of ctc to the reporter genes xylE and lacZ, we also identified mutations that enhanced ctc expression. One such mutation, called socB, was found to be located in an open reading frame immediately downstream of sigB.
