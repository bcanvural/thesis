Molecular cloning and characterization of 13 out genes from Erwinia carotovora subspecies carotovora: genes encoding members of a general secretion pathway (GSP) widespread in gram-negative bacteria.
The chemical mutagen ethylmethanesulphonate (EMS) has been used to generate mutants of Erwinia carotovora subspecies carotovora which are defective in the secretion of pectinases (Pel) and cellulases (Cel) but unaltered for protease (Prt) secretion. Such mutants, called Out-, still synthesize Pel and Cel but these enzymes accumulate within the periplasm. Cosmid clones carrying wild-type E. carotovora ssp. carotovora DNA, identified by their ability to restore the Out+ phenotype when transferred to some Out- mutants, were classified into six complementation groups using cosmids and cosmid derivatives. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of a 12.7 kb DNA fragment, encompassing complementing cosmid inserts, revealed a coding capacity for 13 potential open reading frames (ORFs), and these were designated outC-outO. Some of the out gene products were visualized using a T7 gene 10 expression system. The predicted Out proteins are highly similar to components of extracellular enzyme secretion systems from a diverse range of eubacteria including Erwinia chrysanthemi, Klebsiella oxytoca, Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Xanthomonas campestris. Lower levels of similarity exist between Ecc Out proteins and components of macromolecular trafficking systems from Bacillus subtilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Yersinia pestis and a protein involved in the morphogenesis of filamentous bacteriophages such as M13.
