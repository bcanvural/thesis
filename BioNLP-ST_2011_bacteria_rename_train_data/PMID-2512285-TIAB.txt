In vitro reconstitution of a hexagonal array with a surface layer protein synthesized by Bacillus subtilis harboring the surface layer protein gene from Bacillus brevis 47.
Bacillus brevis 47 contains two surface layer proteins, termed the outer wall protein and the middle wall protein (MWP), which form a hexagonal array in the cell wall. Introduction of the MWP structural gene into Bacillus subtilis by using a low-copy-number plasmid led to the synthesis of an immunoreactive polypeptide with a molecular mass almost the same as that of the MWP synthesized by B. brevis 47. Biochemical analysis indicated that most of the MWP synthesized by B. subtilis was localized in the cytoplasmic fraction. This was further confirmed by using immunogold electron microscopy. The amino-terminal amino acid sequence of the MWP purified from the cytoplasm of B. subtilis indicated that the MWP was precursor with a signal peptide of 23 amino acid residues to the amino terminus of the mature protein. The precursor of the MWP possessed the ability to reassemble in vitro on the B. brevis 47 peptidoglycan layer, resulting in the formation of almost the same hexagonal arrays as with the mature MWP purified from B. brevis 47, judging from images averaged at a resolution of about 2.5 nm. Furthermore, a center-to-center distance of the hexagonal lattice on the envelope reconstituted by using the precursor MWP was calibrated as 18.3 nm, which was almost identical to the value of 17.8 nm obtained with the mature protein.
