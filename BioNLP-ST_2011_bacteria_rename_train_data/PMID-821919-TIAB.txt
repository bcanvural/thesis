Bacillus pumilus plasmid pPL10: properties and insertion into Bacillus subtilis 168 by transformation.
Bacillus pumilus ATCC 12140 harbors 10 or more copies per chromosome of each two small plasmids. Variants of this strain were isolated which were sensitive to a killing activity produced by the plasmid-containing parent. Each of 24 such sensitive (S) variants tested lacked detectable levels of supercoiled deoxyribonucleic acid. Transduction of S variants to the Kill+ phenotype was performed using phage PBP1 propagated on a mutant of ATCC 12140, designated strain L10, that remained Kill+ but retained only a single plasmid species (plasmid pPL10; molecular weight, approximately 4.4 X 10(6), approximately 20 copies per chromosome; RHO = 1.698). Resulting Kill+ transductants of S variants contained a single plasmid species having a size and copy number comparable to that of pPL10. Transfer of pPL10 from strain L10 TO B. pumilus strain NRS 576 was accomplished by transduction with selection for the Kill+ phenotype. Strain NRS 576 naturally harbors about two copies per chromosome of a 28-million-dalton plasmid, pPL576. In Kill + transductants of NRS 576, plasmids pPL10 and pPL576 stably coexisted at a ratio of about 11 molecules of pPL10 to 1 molecule of pPL576. Therefore, pPL576 and pPL10 are compatible plasmids. B. subtilis 168 is naturally resistant to pPl10- determined killing activity. Plasmid pPl10 was therefore inserted into B-subtilis 168 by transformation, using an indirect selection procedure and a spoB mutant as recipient. The plasmid is stably maintained at an estimated 10 copies per chromosome in the spore- recipient and in spore+ transformants. pPL10 is sensitive to cleavage by the endonucleases Hind III and EcoR1.
