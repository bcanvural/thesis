A Bacillus subtilis dnaG mutant harbours a mutation in a gene homologous to the dnaN gene of Escherichia coli.
A dnaG mutation of Bacillus subtilis, dnaG5, was found to be linked closely to recF. We have reported previously that two putative dna genes, 'dnaA' and 'dnaN', highly homologous to Escherichia coli's dnaA and dnaN, respectively, were located adjacent to recF [Ogasawara et al., EMBO J., 4 (1985) 3345-3350]. Transformation by various fragments cloned from the 'dnaA'-recF region of the wild-type cell revealed that a 532-bp AluI fragment containing 5'-portion of the 'dnaN' gene could transform the dnaG5 mutation. The nucleotide (nt) sequence of the same fragment cloned from the mutant cell shows a single nt change in the ORF of 'dnaN' which in turn causes a single amino acid alteration from Gly to Arg. The 'dnaN' gene is now proven to be a dna gene, mutations in which result in instant arrest of chromosomal replication.
