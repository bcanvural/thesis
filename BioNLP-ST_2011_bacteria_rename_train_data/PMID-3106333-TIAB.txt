Structure of the Bacillus subtilis pyrimidine biosynthetic (pyr) gene cluster.
A 10.5-kilobase PstI endonuclease fragment encoding the entire Bacillus subtilis pyrimidine biosynthetic (pyr) gene cluster was cloned in Escherichia coli by transformation of a carB strain to uracil-independent growth. The cloned fragment also complemented E. coli pyrB, pyrC, pyrD, pyrE, and pyrF mutants. From the ability of subclones to complement E. coli pyr mutants, the gene order was deduced to be pyrBCADFE. The B. subtilis pyrB gene was shown to be expressed in E. coli, but synthesis of the enzyme was not repressible by the addition of uracil to the growth medium. The approximate molecular weights of the polypeptides encoded by B. subtilis pyrA, pyrB, pyrC, pyrD, pyrE, and pyrF were found to be 110,000, 36,000, 46,000, 34,000, 25,000, and 27,000, respectively.
