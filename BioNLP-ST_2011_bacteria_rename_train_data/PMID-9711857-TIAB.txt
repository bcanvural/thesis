Molecular analysis of the malR gene of Clostridium butyricum NCIMB 7423, a member of the LacI-GalR family of repressor proteins.
Deletion of a region of DNA 5' to a previously characterised malQ gene of Clostridium butyricum resulted in increased production of the enzyme activity encoded by malQ, 4-alpha-glucanotransferase. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed the presence of an open reading frame capable of encoding a protein of 335 amino acids. This protein was found to share 33% amino acid sequence identity with the Bacillus subtilis CcpA (catabolite control protein) repressor, 28% identity with the Streptomyces coelicolor MalR repressor, and 30%, 25%, and 21% amino acid identity with the Escherichia coli repressors GalR, LacI and MalI, respectively. The amino-terminal domain was predicted to be able to form a helix-turn-helix structure, and shared highest similarity with the equivalent functional domain from the E. coli LacI repressor. Interruption of malR by the generation of a frameshift mutation led to a 10-fold increase in MalQ activity. These data suggest that the identified open reading frame encodes a repressor of the C. butyricum malQ gene, and of the adjacent malP gene. The gene has, therefore, been designated malR, and its encoded gene product MalR.
