Identification of two genes encoding putative new members of the ECF subfamily of eubacterial RNA polymerase sigma factors in Clostridium acetobutylicum.
Two genes from Clostridium acetobutylicum DSM 792 were identified which are predicted to encode new members of the ECF subfamily of eubacterial RNA polymerase sigma factors. The sigX gene has the potential to encode a 184-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 21,870 Da and with the highest overall similarity to Fecl of Escherichia coli (27 % identical residues). The second gene, which is predicted to encode an alternative sigma factor of the ECF subfamily, is the previously described orf2 gene (Gerischer and Durre, 1990) located in the adc gene region of C. acetobutylicum. The deduced protein of orf2 has significant similarity to SigX of C. acetobutylicum (22 % identical residues) and shares structural features with other alternative sigma factors. Therefore, it is proposed to rename orf2 as sigY. Analysis of the phylogenetic relationship revealed that SigX from C. acetobutylicum, together with sigmaE from Streptomyces coelicolor and SigX from Bacillus subtilis, form a gram-positive cluster within the ECF subfamily and that SigY from C. acetobutylicum together with UviA from Clostridium perfringens, form a separate cluster located between the gram-positive cluster and the sporulation sigma factor sigmaH from B. subtilis.
