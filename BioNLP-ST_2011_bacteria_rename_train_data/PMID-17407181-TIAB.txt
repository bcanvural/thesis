Transcriptome and proteome analyses in response to 2-methylhydroquinone and 6-brom-2-vinyl-chroman-4-on reveal different degradation systems involved in the catabolism of aromatic compounds in Bacillus subtilis.
Bacillus subtilis is exposed to a variety of antimicrobial compounds in the soil. In this paper, we report on the response of B. subtilis to the fungal-related antimicrobials 6-brom-2-vinyl-chroman-4-on (chromanon) and 2-methylhydroquinone (2-MHQ) using proteome and transcriptome analyses. Chromanon, a derivative of aposphaerins from Aposphaeria species caused predominant protein damage in B. subtilis as indicated by the induction of the HrcA, CtsR, and Spx regulons. The expression profile of the ganomycin-related substance 2-MHQ was similar to that of catechol as reflected by the common induction of the thiol-specific oxidative stress response. Several putative ring-cleavage dioxygenases and oxidoreductases were differentially up-regulated by 2-MHQ, catechol, and chromanon including yfiDE, ydfNOP, yodED, ycnDE, yodC, and ykcA. The nitroreductase encoding yodC gene is induced in response to catechol, 2-MHQ, and chromanon, which depend on the MarR-type repressor YodB. The yfiDE (catDE) operon encodes a catechol-2,3-dioxygenase which is most strongly induced by catechol. The yodED (mhqED), ydfNOP (mhqNOP) operons, and ykcA (mhqA) respond most strongly to 2-MHQ and encode putative hydroquinone-specific extradiol dioxygenases. The ycnDE operon was most strongly induced by chromanon. Mutational analyses revealed that the putative hydroquinone-specific dioxygenases MhqO and MhqA confer resistance to 2-MHQ in B. subtilis.
