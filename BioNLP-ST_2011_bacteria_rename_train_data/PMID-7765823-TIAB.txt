Cloning and sequencing the degS-degU operon from an alkalophilic Bacillus brevis.
The sacU region from an alkalophilic Bacillus brevis was cloned and sequenced. The two open reading frames of the degS-degU operon encode polypeptides that gave calculated molecular masses of 43.8 kDa and 27.0 kDa, respectively. Sequence comparisons at the amino acid level to the B. subtilis degS-degU genes showed 74% and 84% similarity, respectively. On a multicopy vector the B. brevis degS-degU genes were found to cause hypersecretion of several extracellular enzymes in a B. subtilis rec- strain as well as in a B. subtilis sacU(HY) strain.
