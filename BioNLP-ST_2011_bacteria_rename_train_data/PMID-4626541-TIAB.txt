Intergenotic transformation of the Bacillus subtilis genospecies.
A multiple auxotrophic derivative of Bacillus subtilis 168 (strain BR151 carrying lys-3, trpC2, metB10) was transformed with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) isolated from B. subtilis 168, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens H, B. subtilis HSR, Bacillus pumilus, and Bacillus licheniformis. Transformation with heterologous DNA occurred at a very low frequency for the three auxotrophic markers. Heterologous transformation to rifampin resistance was 100 to 1,000 times more efficient than transformation to prototrophy. Transformants from the various heterologous exchanges were used to prepare donor DNA. The fragment of integrated DNA from the heterologous (foreign) species, termed the "intergenote," was capable of transforming BR151 with an efficiency almost equal to that of homologous DNA. When BR151 DNA contained the Rfm(R) (rifampin resistance) intergenote from B. amyloliquefaciens H, the frequency of transformation was frequently greater than that of the homologous DNA. Accompanying this increased efficiency was a marked change in the physiology of the cells. The growth rate of the transformants carrying this intergenote was approximately one-half that of either parental strain. Thus, in a prokaryotic transformation system, adverse side effects can occur after incorporation of a segment of foreign DNA.
