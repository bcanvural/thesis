Mutation affecting expression of spectinomycin resistance in Bacillus subtilis.
A mutation that affects the expression of spectinomycin resistance in a spectinomycin-resistant (spcA), conditionally asporogenic strain of Bacillus subtilis has been designated srm (spectinomycin resistance modifier). This mutation resulted in altered colony morphology and increased growth rate and sporulation efficiency in the presence of spectinomycin.
