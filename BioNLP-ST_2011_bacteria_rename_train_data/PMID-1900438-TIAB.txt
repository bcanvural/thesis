A limited number of Bacillus subtilis strains carry a tetracycline-resistance determinant at a site close to the origin of replication.
Several strains of Bacillus subtilis, e.g., 168 derivatives and R, were found to carry a single copy of a tetracycline-resistance (TcR) determinant (named tetBS908) at a site close to the origin of replication on the chromosome. This gene is highly homologous (80% identical) to the TcR determinant of plasmids widely dispersed among aerobic spore-forming bacilli. B. subtilis RM125 (168 strain) transformants which carry a varying number of tetBS908 sequences in a tandem array on the chromosome were constructed and examined for their TcR level. A nearly proportional relationship between the TcR level and copy number of tetBS908 existed.
