Inactivation action spectra of Bacillus subtilis spores in extended ultraviolet wavelengths (50-300 nm) obtained with synchrotron radiation.
Five types of Bacillus subtilis spores (UVR, UVS, UVP, RCE, and RCF) differing in repair and/or recombinational capabilities were exposed to monochromatic radiations at 13 wavelengths from 50 to 300 nm in vacuum. An improved biological irradiation system connected to a synchrotron radiation source was used to produce monochromatic UV radiation in this extended wavelength range with sufficient fluence to inactivate bacterial spores. From the survival curves obtained, the action spectra for the inactivation of the spores were depicted. Recombination-deficient RCE (recE) and RCF (recF) spores were more sensitive than the wild-type UVR spores in the entire range of wavelengths. This was considered to mean that DNA was the major target for the inactivation of the spores. Vacuum-UV radiations of 125-175 nm were effective in killing the spores, and distinct peaks of the sensitivity were seen with all types of the spores. Insensitivities at 190 and 100 nm were common to all five types of spores, indicating that these wavelengths were particularly impenetrant and absorbed by the outer layer materials. The vacuum-UV peaks centering at 150 nm were prominent in the spores defective in recombinational repair, while the far-UV peaks at around 235 and 270 nm were prominent in the UVS (uvrA ssp) and UVP (uvrA ssp polA) spores deficient in removal mechanisms of spore photoproducts. Thus, the profiles of the action spectra were explained by three factors; the penetration depth of each radiation in a spore, the efficiency of producing DNA damage that could cause inactivation, and the repair capacity of each type of spore.
