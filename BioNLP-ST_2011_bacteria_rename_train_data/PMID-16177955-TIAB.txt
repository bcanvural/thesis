Structure investigation of Maltacine C1a, C1b, C2a and C2b-cyclic peptide lactones of the Maltacine complex from Bacillus subtilis.
A new complex of cyclic peptide lactone antibiotics from Bacillus subtilis, which we named Maltacines, has recently been described. The structure elucidation of four of them is reported in this paper. The amino acid sequences and structures of the peptides were found by MS(n) of the ring-opened linear peptides, which gave uninterrupted sequences of Bn and Y''n ions. The identities of three unknown residues in the sequences were solved by a combination of derivatisation with phenylisothiocyanate (PITC), high-resolution mass spectrometry and H/D exchange. The nature and position of the cyclic structure was disclosed by a chemo-selective ring opening with Na18OH and was found to be a lactone formed between a hydroxyl of residue number 4 and the C-terminal amino acid number 12. For verification of the structure of the B2+ ion, peptides with different combinations of P/Q and P/K at the N-terminus were synthesised. The structure of the four peptides were found to be: C1a and C2a: cyclo-4,12(P-Q-Y-Adip-V-E-T-Y-Orn-103-Y-I-OH) and C1b/C2b: cyclo-4,12(P-Q-Y-Adip-V-E-T-Y-K-103-Y-I-OH). Adip = aminodihydroxy pentanoic acid.
