The Bacillus subtilis nucleotidyltransferase is a tRNA CCA-adding enzyme.
There has been increased interest in bacterial polyadenylation with the recent demonstration that 3' poly(A) tails are involved in RNA degradation. Poly(A) polymerase I (PAP I) of Escherichia coli is a member of the nucleotidyltransferase (Ntr) family that includes the functionally related tRNA CCA-adding enzymes. Thirty members of the Ntr family were detected in a search of the current database of eubacterial genomic sequences. Gram-negative organisms from the beta and gamma subdivisions of the purple bacteria have two genes encoding putative Ntr proteins, and it was possible to predict their activities as either PAP or CCA adding by sequence comparisons with the E. coli homologues. Prediction of the functions of proteins encoded by the genes from more distantly related bacteria was not reliable. The Bacillus subtilis papS gene encodes a protein that was predicted to have PAP activity. We have overexpressed and characterized this protein, demonstrating that it is a tRNA nucleotidyltransferase. We suggest that the papS gene should be renamed cca, following the notation for its E. coli counterpart. The available evidence indicates that cca is the only gene encoding an Ntr protein, despite previous suggestions that B. subtilis has a PAP similar to E. coli PAP I. Thus, the activity involved in RNA 3' polyadenylation in the gram-positive bacteria apparently resides in an enzyme distinct from its counterpart in gram-negative bacteria.
