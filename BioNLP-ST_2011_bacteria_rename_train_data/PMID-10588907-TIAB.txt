Insertional mutation of orfD of the DCW cluster of Streptococcus pneumoniae attenuates virulence.
Mutational analysis of a 5.5 kb fragment of the genome Streptococcus pneumoniae led to the identification of a putative new virulence gene, designated orfD. Insertion mutagenesis of flanking genes on the fragment suggested that the corresponding gene products were required for in vitro growth. In contrast, insertion mutation of orfD did not alter in vitro growth or the transformability pattern of the mutated strain. However, it did reduce bacterial growth in mice and attenuated virulence in an intraperitoneal model of infection. orfD is flanked by orfC (63 codons) and ftsL (105 codons) and all three genes are upstream of pbpx. orfC showed no similarity with other known proteins. ftsL of S. pneumoniae exhibits minimal sequence similarity with ftsL of E. coli, but shares 16% identical residues with the ftsL homologue encoded by ylld of B. subtilis. Also, ftsL of S. pneumoniae has a predicted topology similar to that described for ftsL of E. coli. Putative promoters with an extended -10 box could be identified upstream of both orfC or orfD. The four open reading frames (including pbpx) are orientated in the same direction, and polycistronic transcription could theoretically start at either promoter. Interestingly, this region shows organizational and sequence homologies with genes controlling division and cell wall biosynthesis (DCW) in other bacteria. The attenuation of virulence in the orfD insertion mutant might be due to the loss of function of the orfD gene product or to an altered level of expression of downstream genes.
