[Fluorescence microscopic study of the microorganisms treated with chaotropic agents] The yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris and the bacteria Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, and Anaerobacter polyendosporus have been treated with the chaotropic agents guanidine hydrochloride and guanidine thiocyanate and certain detergents and studied using fluorescence microscopy.
Studies with the use of fluorochromes that can selectively stain nucleic acids (diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), propidium iodide, and acridine orange) show that treatment of the bacterial and yeast cells at 37 degrees C for 3-5 h induces a release of DNA from the cytoplasm and its accumulation in the cellular zone, known as ectoplasm, located between the cell wall and the remainder of the cytoplasm (called endoplasm) in the form of one or several large granules. After treating the cells with the chaotropic agents at 100 degrees C for 5-6 min, the DNA is diffusively distributed over the ectoplasm. The fluorochromes used do not allow the detection of RNA. These findings are in agreement with previous data obtained from electron microscopic study of thin cell sections. After 33 PCR cycles, a considerable portion of DNA leaves the cells; as a result, they show a low level of diffusive fluorescence when stained with DAPI. When endospores of B. subtilis are treated with the chaotropic agents, they become highly permeable to the fluorochromes. Fluorescence microscopic study of such endospores shows that they contain DNA in the central part of their cores.
