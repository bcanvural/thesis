A generic system for the Escherichia coli cell-surface display of lipolytic enzymes.
EstA is an outer membrane-anchored esterase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. An inactive EstA variant was used as an anchoring motif for the Escherichia coli cell-surface display of lipolytic enzymes. Flow cytometry analysis and measurement of lipase activity revealed that Bacillus subtilis lipase LipA, Fusarium solani pisi cutinase and one of the largest lipases presently known, namely Serratia marcescens lipase were all efficiently exported by the EstA autotransporter and also retained their lipolytic activities upon cell surface exposition. EstA provides a useful tool for surface display of lipases including variant libraries generated by directed evolution thereby enabling the identification of novel enzymes with interesting biological and biotechnological ramifications.
