[Detection of a sodium pump in the terminal segment of the bacterial respiratory chain] An alkalo- and halotolerant aerobic microorganism has been isolated which, according to microbiological data and the ribosomal 5S-RNA sequence, is a Bacillus similar, but not identical, to B. licheniformis and B. subtilis. The microorganism termed as Bacillus FTU proved to be resistant to the protonophorous uncoupler CCCP. The fast growth of Bacillus FTU in the presence of CCCP was shown to require high Na+ concentrations in the medium. A procedure has been developed to exhaust endogenous respiratory substrates in Bacillus FTU cells so that fast oxygen consumption by the cells was observed only upon addition of an exogenous respiratory substrate. The exhausted cells were found to oxidize ascorbate in the presence of TMPD in a cyanide-sensitive fashion. Ascorbate oxidation was coupled to the uphill Na+ extrusion stimulated by CCCP and a penetrating weak base, diethylamine (DEA), as well as by valinomycin with or without DEA. The operation of the Bacillus FTU terminal oxidase resulted in the generation of delta psi which, in a Na+ medium, was slightly decreased by CCCP and strongly by CCCP + DEA. In a K+ medium CCCP discharged delta psi even without DEA. Ascorbate oxidation was competent in ATP synthesis which was resistant to CCCP in the Na+ medium and sensitive to CCCP in the K+ medium. CCCP + DEA were inhibitory in both media. The data obtained indicate that there is a Na+-motive terminal oxidase in Bacillus FTU. It is suggested that delta microNa formed by the oxidase can be utilized by an Na+-driven ATP-synthase.
