Isolation, amino acid sequence, and synthesis of dermaseptin, a novel antimicrobial peptide of amphibian skin.
A 34-residue antimicrobial peptide named dermaseptin was purified to homogeneity from amphibian skin by a 3-step protocol involving molecular sieve filtration, ion-exchange chromatography, and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The complete amino acid sequence of dermaseptin, ALWKTMLKKLGTMALHAGKAALGAAADTISQGTQ, was determined by automated Edman degradation of the peptide and of fragments generated by trypsin. Fast atom bombardment mass spectra of dermaseptin gave a protonated molecular ion m/z 3455.4 which matched the theoretical molecular weight predicted from the amino acid sequence. Dermaseptin was synthesized by the solid-phase method. The synthetic replicate was shown to be indistinguishable from natural dermaseptin with respect to chromatographic properties, amino acid sequence determination, and mass spectrometry analysis. Dermaseptin is a water-soluble, thermostable, and nonhemolytic peptide endowed with highly potent antimicrobial activity against pathogenic fungi at micromolar concentration. Circular dichroism spectra of dermaseptin in hydrophobic media indicated 80% alpha-helical conformation, and predictions of secondary structure suggested that dermaseptin can be configured as an amphiphatic alpha-helix spanning over residues 1-27, a structure that perturbs membrane functions regulating water flux.
