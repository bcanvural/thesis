Transformation in quasi spheroplasts of Bacillus subtilis.
RECENTLY DEVELOPED DIFFERENTIAL PLATING MEDIA PERMIT THE DISTINCTION OF FOUR CELL TYPES IN INCOMPLETELY PROTOPLASTED POPULATIONS: intact, osmotically insensitive bacilli; osmotically sensitive rods; spheres with adherent wall residues, called quasi spheroplasts; and protoplasts. Such population mixtures were washed free of lysozyme, and then transforming deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was added. Transformation was nil in the protoplasts, very low in the residual osmotically insensitive bacilli, and markedly enhanced in both osmotically sensitive rods and quasi spheroplasts. Transformation in the latter two population fractions was reduced, respectively, by about 60% and about 80% by deoxyribonuclease treatment. DNA adhering to the quasi spheroplasts transforms these cells only if they are permitted to resume wall synthesis; when the same cells are plated on a medium where they shed the residual wall and form L colonies, no transformant L colonies are recovered. It is inferred that far-reaching or complete protoplasting blocks all entry of transforming DNA into the cell interior. This may be owing to eversion of mesosomes. Evidence that intact mesosomes may be required for DNA entry is provided by the finding that the recovery of transformants in the intact cell system is sharply reduced on plating media containing 25% gelatin. On such media, cells expel their mesosomes and 75% of them do not re-form any. Our own data and a survey of published results suggest the generalization that partial depolymerization of the cell wall by lysozyme may enhance competence, whereas its complete removal abolishes it.
