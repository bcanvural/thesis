A site-specific recE4-independent intramolecular recombination between Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus DNAs in hybrid plasmids.
A composite plasmid pLS253 was constructed from pLS103 [carrying the Bacillus subtilis leucine genes on B. subtilis (natto) plasmid pLS28] and pHV14 [a recombinant plasmid composed of pBR322 and the staphylococcal R-plasmid pC194] employing BamHI endonuclease, T4 DNA ligase, and B. subtilis transformation. All the Leu+ Cmr transformants tested harbored not only pLS253 but also two smaller plasmids designated as pLS251 and pLS252. pLS253 DNA, when purified on an agarose gel, retained both Leu+ and Cmr transforming activities; however, in all the Leu+ Cmr transformants, the two smaller plasmids reappeared. pLS251 and pLS252 exhibited Leu+- or Cm4-transforming activity, respectively, and must have been derived from the pLS253 parent by an intramolecular recombination event, since the sum of the pLS251 and pLS252 DNAs represent the entire pLS253 genome. The recombination occurred between specific sites on the B. subtilis (natto) and Staphylococcus aureus plasmids. When the composite plasmid, pLS254, was constructed by BamHI cleavage of pLS251 and pLS252 followed by ligation, Leu+ Cmr transformants segregated two smaller plasmids which were indistinguishable from the original plasmids pLS103 and pHV14, respectively. They must have been derived from pLS254 through a reversal of the original recombination event. No intermolecular recombination between pLS251 and pLS252 DNA was detected. The recombination process was independent of recE function of the host cells, and its mechanism is discussed.
