Suppression of defective-sporulation phenotypes by mutations in the major sigma factor gene (rpoD) of Bacillus subtilis.
Mutations (crsA47 and crsA4) in the major sigma factor gene (rpoD) of Bacillus subtilis RNA polymerase have been found to be powerful intergenic suppressors of spoOB, spoOE, spoOF, spoOK and spoIIG mutations. The crsA47 suppressor restores sporulation of spoOE, spoOF, spoOK and spoIIG mutants to levels near those of wild type bacteria and substantially improves the sporulation of a spoOB strain. The crsA mutations are shown to prevent the induction by aliphatic alcohols of SpoO phenocopies in wild type B. subtilis cells.
