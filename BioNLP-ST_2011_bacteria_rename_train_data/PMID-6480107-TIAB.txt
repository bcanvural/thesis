Lactose transport in Streptococcus mutans: isolation and characterization of factor IIIlac, a specific protein component of the phosphoenolpyruvate-lactose phosphotransferase system.
The transport of lactose in Streptococcus mutans is mediated via an inducible phosphoenolpyruvate-lactose phosphotransferase system. This system requires for catalytic activity a membrane fraction (enzyme II), two general proteins called enzyme I and HPr, and a soluble specific protein termed factor IIIlac. This protein factor was purified from S. mutans ATCC 27352 by chromatographies on DEAE-cellulose, hydroxylapatite, Ultrogel AcA 34, and phosphocellulose. The purified protein migrated as a single band with a molecular weight of 10,000 on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and urea. The molecular weight calculated from the amino acid composition was 10,541. Gel filtration of the native protein gave a molecular weight of 41,500. Its isoelectric point was ca. 4.70. A specific antiserum was prepared against purified factor IIIlac. Immunodiffusion experiments revealed that only cellular extracts from lactose-grown cells contained factor IIIlac. A cross-reaction was observed with all of the S. mutans strains tested as well as with Streptococcus sanguis 10556, Streptococcus lactis 11454, and Staphylococcus aureus 6538. No precipitin band was observed with extracts of Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus casei, and Bacillus subtilis.
