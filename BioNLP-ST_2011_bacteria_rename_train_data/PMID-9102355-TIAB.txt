[Genetic mapping of an additional regulatory locus of the riboflavin operon of Bacillus subtilis] Two mutations designated ribR5 and ribR6, which effectively decrease the constitutive expression of the Bacillus subtilis riboflavin operon, were mapped in the 236 degrees region of the B. subtilis genetic map based on linkage analysis with respect to the apt6 marker. Cotransfer indices for the ribR5 and ribR6 markers and apt6 suggest that both ribR mutations are alleles of exactly the same genetic locus. Total results of transductional and transformational crosses indicate the following marker order: pheA-apt6-ribR-azlB-aroD4. Phenotypic peculiarities of the ribR mutants allow us to assume that they belong to an additional subunit of the regulatory protein of the riboflavin operon.
