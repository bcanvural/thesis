Bsu2413I and Bfi2411I, two new thermophilic type II restriction endonucleases from Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus firmus: isolation and partial purification.
Thermophilic endonucleases from two Bacillus species. Two new thermophilic type II restriction endonucleases, which we designated as Bsu2413I and Bfi2411I, have been isolated from gram-positive thermophilic bacteria Bacillus subtilis strain 2413 and Bacillus firmus strain 2411 respectively and partially purified. The restriction endonucleases were extracted from cell extracts and purified using single step purification through phosphocellulose column chromatography. SDS-PAGE profile showed denatured molecular weights of 33 and 67 kDa for the Bsu2413I and 39 and 67 kDa for the Bfi2411I. The partially purified Bsu2413I enzyme restricted pBR322 DNA into two fragments of 3250 and 1100 bp whereas Bfi2411I enzyme restricted pBR322 DNA into two fragments of 3500 and 800 bp. The activity of both endonucleases was assayed at 55 degrees C and they required Mg+2 as cofactor like other type II restriction endonucleases.
