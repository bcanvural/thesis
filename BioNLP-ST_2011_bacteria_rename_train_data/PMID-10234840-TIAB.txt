Assembly of the CotSA coat protein into spores requires CotS in Bacillus subtilis.
The CotSA protein, encoded by cotSA (ytxN) of Bacillus subtilis, was detected from the cells at 5 h after the onset of sporulation (T5) and in the spore coat of wild-type cells, but not in cotE, cotS, gerE, or cotSA mutant spores. CotSA was also detected in the sporangium at T5 to T7 but not in the sporangium at T18 of cotS mutant cells, while the incorporation of CotS into the coat was not dependent upon CotSA. These results suggested that CotSA was synthesized simultaneously with CotS during T5 to T7 of sporulation and assembled into the coat dependent upon CotS.
