Multiple principal sigma factor homologs in eubacteria: identification of the "rpoD box".
Genes for the principal sigma factor (rpoD genes) of various eubacteria were identified with a synthetic oligonucleotide probe corresponding to a conserved sequence in rpoD gene products of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. Multiple rpoD homologs were found in the strains of Micrococcus, Pseudomonas, and Streptomyces, whereas single genes were detected in E. coli, B. subtilis, and Staphylococcus aureus. The four rpoD homologs of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) were cloned and sequenced. A homologous portion with 13 amino acids was found in the rpoD genes of S. coelicolor A3(2), E. coli, and B. subtilis and was named the "rpoD box."
