Bacillus subtilis mutants with alterations in ribosomal protein S4.
Two mutants with different alterations in the electrophoretic mobility of ribosomal protein S4 were isolated as spore-plus revertants of a streptomycin-resistant, spore-minus strain of Bacillus subtilis. The mutations causing the S4 alterations, designated rpsD1 and rpsD2, were located between the argGH and aroG genes, at 263 degrees on the B. subtilis chromosome, distant from the major ribosomal protein gene cluster at 12 degrees. The mutant rpsD alleles were isolated by hybridization using a wild-type rpsD probe, and their DNA sequences were determined. The two mutants contained alterations at the same position within the S4-coding sequence, in a region containing a 12-bp tandem duplication; the rpsD1 allele corresponded to an additional copy of this repeated segment, resulting in the insertion of four amino acids, whereas the rpsD2 allele corresponded to deletion of one copy of this segment, resulting in the loss of four amino acids. The effects of these mutations, alone and in combination with streptomycin resistance mutations, on growth, sporulation, and streptomycin resistance were analyzed.
