Localization of rRNA synthesis in Bacillus subtilis: characterization of loci involved in transcription focus formation.
In Bacillus subtilis, RNA polymerase becomes concentrated into regions of the nucleoid called transcription foci. With green fluorescent protein-tagged RNA polymerase, these structures are only observed at higher growth rates and have been shown to represent the sites of rRNA synthesis. There are 10 rRNA (rrn) operons distributed around nearly half of the chromosome. In this study we analyzed the rrn composition of transcription foci with fluorescently tagged loci and showed that they comprise the origin-proximal operon rrnO but not the more dispersed rrnE or rrnD. This suggests that transcription foci comprise only the seven origin-proximal operons rrnO, rrnA, rrnJ, rrnW, rrnI, rrnH, and rrnG. These results have important implications for our understanding of microbial chromosome structure.
