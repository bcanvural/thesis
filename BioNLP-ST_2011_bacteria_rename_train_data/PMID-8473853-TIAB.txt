Molecular and enzymological evidence for two classes of fumarase in Bacillus stearothermophilus (var. non-diastaticus). The gene (fumABst) encoding an oxygen-labile fumarase of Bacillus stearothermophilus has been cloned and sequenced. The structural gene (1542 bp) encodes a product (FumABst) of M(r) 56,788 containing 514 amino acid residues. The amino acid sequence is 23% identical (37% similar) to FumA and FumB, the labile [4Fe-4S]-containing fumarases (Class I enzymes) of Escherichia coli. It exhibits no significant similarity to FumC and CitG, the stable fumarases (Class II enzymes) of E. coli and Bacillus subtilis (respectively). Enzymological studies indicated that FumABst resembles the iron-sulphur-containing fumarases in being dimeric (M(r) 2 x 58,500), oxygen labile and partially reactivated by Fe2+ plus DTT. The fumABst gene is the first gene encoding a Class I fumarase to be characterized in any organism other than E. coli. Enzymological and DNA-hybridization studies further indicated that B. stearothermophilus resembles E. coli in containing an oxygen-stable fumarase (Class II enzyme). Sequence comparisons revealed significant similarities between the Class I fumarases and the products of adjacent open-reading frames (orfZ1 and orfZ2) located upstream of the macromolecular synthesis operon (rpsU-dnaG-rpoD) at 67 min in the E.coli linkage map. Located downstream of fumABst, there is an unidentified gene (orf2), which is homologous to the rhizobial nodB genes involved in the initiation of root nodule formation.
