Localization of Bacillus subtilis sacU(Hy) mutations to two linked genes with similarities to the conserved procaryotic family of two-component signalling systems.
Mutations in the sacU region have a pleiotropic phenotype. Certain mutations designated sacU(Hy), for example, express degradative enzymes at high levels, are able to sporulate in the presence of glucose, have severely reduced transformation efficiencies, and are nonmotile. We isolated and sequenced the sacU gene region of Bacillus subtilis. Two open reading frames were found in the sacU region, and sacU(Hy) mutations were localized to both of these open reading frames. The two open reading frames have similarities to two widespread families of proteins that mediate responses to environmental stimuli.
