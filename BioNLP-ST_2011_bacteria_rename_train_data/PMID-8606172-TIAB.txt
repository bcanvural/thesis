LicT, a Bacillus subtilis transcriptional antiterminator protein of the BglG family.
Gene licS of Bacillus subtilis encodes an excreted Beta-1,3-1,4-endoglucanase necessary for lichenan utilization. Upstream of licS we found a gene (termed licT) together with its promoter which encodes a transcriptional antiterminator of the BglG family. Genes licT and licS are separated by a palindromic sequence (lic-t) reminiscent of transcriptional terminators recognized by the antiterminator proteins of the BglG family. The LicT protein can prevent termination at terminator lic-t and also at terminator t2 of the Escherichia coli bgl operon and BglG prevents termination at lic-t. The role of LicT in licS regulation by preventing termination at its terminator lic-t appears to be limited since expression of licS is inducible only two- to threefold. This limited regulation is mainly due to a high basal level of licS expression which can in part be attributed to the presence of a second promoter preceding licS and located downstream of lic-t. However, disruption of gene licT leads not only to loss of inducibility of licS but also to loss of growth on lichenan or on its degradation products, indicating its stringent role in beta-glucan utilization.
