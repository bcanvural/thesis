Bacillus subtilis contains a cyclodextrin-binding protein which is part of a putative ABC-transporter.
Bacillus subtilis is able to grow on alpha-, beta- and gamma-cyclodextrins as a carbon source via a yet unknown metabolizing system. Sequence analysis of the B. subtilis genome reveals that the putative yvfK-yvfO operon seems to be involved in cyclodextrin utilization, containing the open reading frame yvfK, now termed cycB. The amino acid sequence derived from the DNA sequence bears high similarities to solute-binding proteins from B. subtilis, as well as to cymE from Klebsiella oxytoca and malE from Escherichia coli, both encoding solute-binding proteins able to interact with cyclodextrins. A [His](6)-tagged variant of CycB from B. subtilis was constructed, overproduced in E. coli and purified. The modified protein has been used to study its substrate specificity by surface plasmon resonance and fluorescence spectroscopy. From these data, CycB can be classified as a cyclodextrin-binding protein which interacts with all three natural cyclodextrins: alpha, beta and gamma, thereby showing the highest affinity to gamma-cyclodextrin.
