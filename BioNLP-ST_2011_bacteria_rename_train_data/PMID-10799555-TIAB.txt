Specific recognition of parental terminal protein by DNA polymerase for initiation of protein-primed DNA replication.
The linear genome of Bacillus subtilis phage phi29 has a protein covalently linked to the 5' ends, called parental terminal protein (TP), and is replicated using a free TP as primer. The initiation of phage phi29 DNA replication requires the formation of a DNA polymerase/TP complex that recognizes the replication origins located at the genome ends. The DNA polymerase catalyzes the formation of the initiation complex TP-dAMP, and elongation proceeds coupled to strand displacement. The same mechanism is used by the related phage Nf. However, DNA polymerase and TP from phi29 do not initiate the replication of Nf TP-DNA. To address the question of the specificity of origin recognition, we took advantage of the initiation reaction enhancement in the presence of Mn(2+), allowing us to detect initiation activity in heterologous systems in which DNA polymerase, TP, and template TP-DNA are not from the same phage. Initiation was selectively stimulated when DNA polymerase and TP-DNA were from the same phage, strongly suggesting that specific recognition of origins is brought through an interaction between DNA polymerase and parental TP.
