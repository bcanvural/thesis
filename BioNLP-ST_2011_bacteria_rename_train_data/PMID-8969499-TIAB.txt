The 52 degrees-55 degrees segment of the Bacillus subtilis chromosome: a region devoted to purine uptake and metabolism, and containing the genes cotA, gabP and guaA and the pur gene cluster within a 34960 bp nucleotide sequence.
Within the framework of the international project for sequencing the entire Bacillus subtilis genome, we have determined the complete sequence of the segment flanking the purE-D gene cluster (55 degrees) as far as cotA (52 degrees). This segment (34960 bp) contains, as well as 12 genes already identified as part of the pur operon, 17 putative ORFs and one partial one. Two of them (gabP and guaA) are known B. subtilis genes. The gene product of cotA (formerly pig) shows significant similarity to oxidoreductases (phenoxazine synthase and bilirubin oxidase). The putative products of ORFs yeaB (Czd protein), yeaC (MoxR), yebA (CNG-channel and cGMP-channel proteins from eukaryotes), yebB (hypothetical 32.9 kDa protein of Escherichia coli), yecA (amino acid permease) and yecB (adenine deaminase) were similar to proteins in data banks.
