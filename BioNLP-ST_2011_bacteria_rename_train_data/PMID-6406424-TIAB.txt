Plasmid marker rescue transformation in Bacillus subtilis.
We constructed an 18-megadalton plasmid (pBD221) carrying resistance determinants for kanamycin, chloramphenicol, and erythromycin, as well as the hisH determinant from the Bacillus licheniformis chromosome. This plasmid has a copy number of about one and can be stably maintained in Bacillus subtilis. Linear fragments of pBD221 DNA were used to transform competent cultures carrying mutant variants of the same plasmid. Rescue transformation did not proceed by recircularization and replication of the donor DNA. Rescue transformation exhibited first-order dependence on DNA concentration, and the concentration dependence curve was virtually identical to the curve obtained with chromosomal DNA. The donor DNA molecular weight dependence of plasmid marker rescue transformation obtained by using restriction fragments was not distinguishable from previously published data obtained by using fractionated sheared chromosomal DNA. Plasmid rescue transformation, like chromosomal transformation, was dependent on the recE, recA, recB, and recD gene products. Plasmid rescue transformation, like chromosomal transformation, proceeded with few exchanges. Linkage data obtained with the plasmid rescue system fit a quantitative model based on studies with chromosomal transformation. We conclude that plasmid marker rescue transformation probably proceeds by a mechanism similar to the mechanism used during the formation of chromosomal transformants and hence may be considered an appropriate general model for the study of transformational recombination.
