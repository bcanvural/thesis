Characterization of the genes coding for two major cell wall proteins from protein-producing Bacillus brevis 47: complete nucleotide sequence of the outer wall protein gene.
Bacillus brevis 47 contains two cell wall proteins termed the outer wall protein (OWP) and middle wall protein (MWP), each of which forms hexagonal arrays in the cell wall. A 6-kilobase BglII-BclI fragment of B. brevis 47 DNA cloned into Bacillus subtilis with a derivative of pHW1 as a vector directed the synthesis of a polypeptide, with almost the same molecular weight as the authentic OWP, as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which was specifically recognized by the anti-OWP antibody. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the subfragment revealed that it contains two open reading frames in tandem. The upstream truncated open reading frame corresponds to the carboxy-terminal portion of the MWP, and the downstream open reading frame corresponds to the entire translational portion of the OWP. The latter encodes a secretory precursor of the OWP, consisting of a total of 1,004 amino acid residues with a signal peptide of 24 amino acid residues at its amino-terminal end. Futhermore, analysis of transcripts in B. brevis 47 suggests that the MWP and OWP genes, in that order, constitute a cotranscriptional unit and that the major promoter shared by the two genes is located upstream of the MWP gene.
