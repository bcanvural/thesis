Genetic analysis of a streptomycin-resistant oligosporogenous Bacillus subtilis mutant.
Strain SRB15T+, a streptomycin-resistant, oligosporogenous mutant of Bacillus subtilis, contains two mutations, fun and strR. These mutations were mapped by PBS-1 mediated transduction and by transformation to two different sites in the cysA-linked region of the B. subtilis chromosome. The fun mutation mapped very close to rpsLl, a classic strA mutation, whereas strR mapped to a site distal to rpsE. The effects of these mutations on growth, sporulation, and streptomycin resistance in vivo and in vitro were determined. The fun mutation gave a different phenotype than did the rpsLl mutation and caused altered migration of a ribosomal protein which was identified as S12, the protein encoded by rpsL. It therefore appears that fun is an allele of the rpsL gene.
