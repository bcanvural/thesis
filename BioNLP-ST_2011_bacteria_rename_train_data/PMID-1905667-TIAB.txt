Gene-protein relationships in the flagellar hook-basal body complex of Bacillus subtilis: sequences of the flgB, flgC, flgG, fliE and fliF genes.
The nucleotide sequence of five genes from the major Bacillus subtilis chemotaxis locus has been determined. Four of these genes encode proteins that are homologous to the Salmonella typhimurium FlgB, FlgC, FlgG and FliF proteins. One gene encodes a protein that is homologous to the Escherichia coli FliE protein. The data from S. typhimurium and E. coli suggest that all of these proteins form part of the hook-basal body (HBB) complex of the bacterial flagella. The FlgB, FlgC and FlgG proteins are components of the proximal and distal rods. The FliF protein forms the M-ring that anchors the rod assembly to the membrane. The role of the FliE protein within the HBB complex has not yet been determined. The similarity between the B. subtilis and S. typhimurium proteins suggests that the structure of the M-ring and the rod may be similar in the two species. However, we observed some differences in size and amino acid composition between some of the corresponding homologues that suggest the basal body proteins may be organized slightly differently within B. subtilis.
