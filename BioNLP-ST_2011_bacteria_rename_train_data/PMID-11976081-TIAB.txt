Identification of a salt-induced primary transporter for glycine betaine in the methanogen Methanosarcina mazei Go1.
The salt adaptation of the methanogenic archaeon Methanosarcina mazei Go1 was studied at the physiological and molecular levels. The freshwater organism M. mazei Go1 was able to adapt to salt concentrations up to 1 M, and the addition of the compatible solute glycine betaine to the growth medium facilitated adaptation to higher salt concentrations. Transport studies with cell suspensions revealed a salt-induced glycine betaine uptake activity in M. mazei Go1, and inhibitor studies argue for a primary transport device. Analysis of the genome of M. mazei Go1 identified a homolog of known primary glycine betaine transporters. This gene cluster was designated Ota (osmoprotectant transporter A). Its sequence and gene organization are very similar to those of the glycine betaine transporter OpuA of Bacillus subtilis. Northern blot analysis of otaC revealed a salt-dependent transcription of this gene. Ota is the first identified salt-induced transporter for compatible solutes in ARCHAEA:
