Cloning, sequencing, and molecular analysis of the dnaK locus from Bacillus subtilis.
By using an internal part of the dnaK gene from Bacillus megaterium as a probe, a 5.2-kb HindIII fragment of chromosomal DNA of Bacillus subtilis was cloned. Downstream sequences were isolated by in vivo chromosome walking. Sequencing of 5,085 bp revealed four open reading frames in the order orf39-grpE-dnaK-dnaJ. orf39 encodes a 39-kDa polypeptide of unknown biological function with no noticeable homology to any other protein within the data bases. Alignment of the GrpE protein with those of three other bacterial species revealed a low overall homology, but a higher homology restricted to two regions which might be involved in interactions with other proteins. Alignment of the DnaK protein with six bacterial DnaK polypeptides revealed that a contiguous region of 24 amino acids is absent from the DnaK proteins of all known gram-positive species. Primer extension studies revealed three potential transcription start sites, two preceding orf39 (S1 and S2) and a third one in front of grpE (S3). S2 and S3 were activated at a high temperature. Northern (RNA) analysis led to the detection of three mRNA species of 4.9, 2.6, and 1.5 kb. RNA dot blot experiments revealed an at-least-fivefold increase in the amount of specific mRNA from 0 to 5 min postinduction and then a rapid decrease. A transcriptional fusion between dnaK and the amyL reporter gene exhibited a slight increase in alpha-amylase activity after heat induction. A 9-bp inverted repeat was detected in front of the coding region of orf39. This inverted repeat is present in a number of other heat shock operons in other microorganisms ranging from cyanobacteria to mycobacteria. The biological property of this inverted repeat as a putative key element in the induction of heat shock genes is discussed. The dnaK locus was mapped at about 223 degrees on the B. subtilis genetic map.
