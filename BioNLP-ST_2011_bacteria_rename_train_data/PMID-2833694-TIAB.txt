[Isolation and characteristics of a plasmid from the thermotolerant strain of Bacillus licheniformis] A 8.3 kb cryptic plasmid was isolated from the thermotolerant strain of Bacillus licheniformis 28KA and designated pLT83. The replicative (rep) region was localized on the plasmid map. The pLT83 plasmid labelled in vitro with an antibiotic resistance determinant is able to replicate in B. subtilis cells. The pLT83 plasmid replicates stably in B. licheniformis strain at higher temperatures (37-60 degrees C) than in B. subtilis cells (37-50 degrees C). The plasmid and its derivatives may be used as vectors for gene cloning in B. subtilis and B. licheniformis cells.
