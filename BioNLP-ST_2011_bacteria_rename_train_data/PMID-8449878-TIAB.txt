Cloning and characterization of a gene required for assembly of the Bacillus subtilis spore coat.
During endospore formation in Bacillus subtilis, approximately a dozen proteins are synthesized and assembled around the prespore to form a protective coat. Little is known about the assembly process, but several of the genes encoding these coat proteins are expressed in the mother cell compartment, where the proteins accumulate on the outer side of the developing endospore. Transcription of these genes is directed by the mother cell-specific sigma factor, sigma K, during the later stages of endospore development. sigma E may direct expression of the genes that encode proteins that function in the earliest stages of coat assembly. By screening for sigma E-dependent promoters, we cloned a gene, designated spoVID, required for assembly of a normal spore coat. Expression of spoVID was initiated at about the second hour of sporulation and continued throughout development from a sigma E-dependent promoter. The spoVID gene was located on the B. subtilis chromosome just downstream of the previously characterized hemAXCDBL operon and is predicted to encode an extremely acidic protein with 575 residues. Insertion mutants of spoVID produced refractile spores that were resistant to heat and to chloroform but were sensitive to lysozyme. Electron microscopic examination of sporulating spoVID mutant cells revealed normal morphological development up to about the third hour of sporulation. However, during the later stages of development the coat proteins assembled into aberrant structures that occurred freely in the mother cell cytoplasm and that consisted of reiterations of the single inner and outer layers that normally make up the spore coat.
