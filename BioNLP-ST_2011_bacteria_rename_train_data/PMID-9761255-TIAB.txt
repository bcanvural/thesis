Rapid pathogen detection using a microchip PCR array instrument.
An array of PCR microchips for rapid, parallel testing of samples for pathogenic microbes is described. The instrument, called the Advanced Nucleic Acid Analyzer (ANAA), utilizes 10 silicon reaction chambers with thin-film resistive heaters and solid-state optics. Features of the system include efficient heating and real-time monitoring, low power requirements for battery operation, and no moving parts for reliability and ruggedness. We analyzed cultures of Erwinia herbicola vegetative cells, Bacillus subtilis spores, and MS2 virions, which simulated pathogenic microbes such as Yersinia pestis, Bacillus anthracis spores, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis, respectively. Detection of microbes was achieved in as little as 16 min with detection limits of 10(5)-10(7) organisms/L (10(2)-10(4) organisms/mL).
