A Bacillus subtilis large ORF coding for a polypeptide highly similar to polyketide synthases.
The nucleotide (nt) sequence of 13.6 kb of the outG locus of Bacillus subtilis, which maps at approximately 155 degrees between the genetic markers nrdA and polC, was determined. One putative coding sequence was identified corresponding to a large polypeptide of 4427 amino acids (aa). Structural organization at the nt and aa sequence level and extensive similarities of the deduced product, especially to EryA, suggest that the locus is potentially responsible for the synthesis of a polyketide molecule. The locus has been renamed pksX. Comparison of the deduced product with known fatty acid and polyketide synthases (PKS) suggested the presence of beta-ketosynthase, dehydratase, beta-ketoreductase and acyl-carrier protein domains. Preliminary data obtained with deletion mutants indicate that pksX is not an essential gene.
