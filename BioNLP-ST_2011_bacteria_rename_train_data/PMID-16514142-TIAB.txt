Pectate lyase C from Bacillus subtilis: a novel endo-cleaving enzyme with activity on highly methylated pectin.
The gene yvpA from Bacillus subtilis was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. It encoded a pectate lyase of 221 amino acids that was denominated PelC. The heterologously expressed enzyme was purified by His-tag affinity chromatography and characterized. PelC depolymerized polygalacturonate and pectins of methyl esterification degree from 22 % to 89 %, exhibiting maximum activity on 22 % esterified citrus pectin. It showed an absolute Ca2+ requirement and the optimum temperature and pH were 65 degrees C and pH 10, respectively. The deduced amino acid sequence of PelC showed 53 % identity to pectate lyase PelA from Paenibacillus barcinonensis, which was also characterized. Similarly to PelC, purified PelA showed activity on polygalacturonate and pectins with a high degree of methyl esterification. The two enzymes cleaved pectic polymers to a mixture of oligogalacturonates, indicating an endo mode of action. Analysis of activity on trigalacturonate showed that PelC cleaved it to galacturonic acid and unsaturated digalacturonate, whereas PelA did not show activity on this substrate. PelC and PelA showed high homology to a few recently identified pectate lyases of family 3 and form with them a cluster of small-sized pectate lyases from non-pathogenic micro-organisms.
