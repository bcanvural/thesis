Influence of spo mutations on sigma E synthesis in Bacillus subtilis.
Bacillus subtilis mutants blocked at the same stage of development (stage II) as strains with mutations in the structural gene for sigma E (sigE[spoIIGB]) were analyzed immunologically for sigma E and its precursor protein, P31. Mutations at spoIIL, spoIIN, and spoIIJ loci but not at the spoIIM locus significantly reduced P31 formation. Mutations at the spoIIAA, spoIIAC, spoIIEA, spoIIEB, and spoIIEC loci did not affect P31 synthesis but blocked its processing into sigma E. These results demonstrate a requirement for at least eight stage II gene products in the developmental pathway which leads to sigma E and brings to 11 the number of stage II genes (including spoIIGA, spoIIGB, and spoIIF) now known to be needed for sigma E formation.
