Genetic mapping and physiological consequences of metE mutations of Bacillus subtilis.
Three metE mutations of Bacillus subtilis, which cause cells to have a 25- to 200-fold decrease in L-methionine S-adenosyltransferase (EC 2.5.1.6) activity, were mapped between bioB and thr. The corresponding three metE mutants contained three- to fourfold less intracellular S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) but at least sevenfold more methionine than the metE+ strain when grown in synthetic medium. This indicates a strong feedback control of SAM on its synthesis. However, only the metE2 strain, with the lowest SAM concentration, grew at a slightly lower rate than the parent, which showed that an intracellular concentration of about 25 microM SAM was critical for growth at the normal rate. Neither DNA methylation (measured by bacteriophage luminal diameter 105 restriction) nor sporulation was affected at this low SAM concentration. Addition of methionine to the growth medium caused an increase in the pool of SAM in some but not all metE mutants. Coaddition of adenine did not change this result. However, the extent of sporulation (induced by mycophenolic acid) was decreased 50-fold in all mutants by the addition of methionine and adenine. Therefore, the combination of methionine and adenine suppresses sporulation regardless of whether it causes an increase in the level of SAM.
