Nucleotide sequence of the cellulase gene celF of Clostridium thermocellum.
The nucleotide sequence of the celF gene of Clostridium thermocellum was determined. The open reading frame extended over 2217 bp. The encoded 739-aa polypeptide, CelF, with a Mw = 82,015, was an endoglucanase with activity against carboxymethylcellulose. The N terminus showed a typical signal peptide, and a cleavage site after Ala-27 was predicted. From residues 28 to 470, the sequence of CelF was related to the catalytic domains of type E2 endoglucanases, with a strong homology to the endoglucanases CelZ of Clostridium stercorarium and CenB of Cellulomonas fimi. The catalytic region was followed by a 134-aa segment also present in C. stercorarium CelZ and in C. fimi CenB, and belonging to the family of non-catalytic, presumably cellulose-binding domains first identified in Bacillus subtilis endoglucanase. A 21-aa segment rich in Pro/Thr/Ser residues separated the putative cellulose-binding region from the COOH-terminal region, which contained two conserved stretches of 24 amino acids closely similar to those previously described in endoglucanases CelA, CelB, CelD, CelE, CelH and CelX, and xylanase XynZ of C. thermocellum.
