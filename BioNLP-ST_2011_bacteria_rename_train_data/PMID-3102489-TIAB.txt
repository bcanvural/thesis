Isolation of a rat mitochondrial release factor.
Accommodation of the changed genetic code for termination. A single release factor has been isolated and partially purified from rat mitochondria. It requires ethanol in addition to the specific termination codon when assayed in a heterologous system with Escherichia coli ribosomes. The factor recognizes the codons UAA and UAG but not UGA, and therefore it has been designated mtRF-1. A factor of the bacterial RF-2 type, which in E. coli recognizes UGA, or of the mammalian type, which recognizes all three termination codons, has not been detected in mitochondria. The absence of a factor responding to UGA accommodates the use of this codon as a signal for tryptophan in the rat mitochondrial genetic code. The mtRF-1 could translate all of the known termination codons in the rat mitochondrial genome. It does not respond to AGG and AGA which in bovine and human mitochondrial DNA code for termination but which in rat mitochondria may not code for either an amino acid or for termination.
