A tale of two genomes: resolution of dimeric chromosomes in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis.
Dimeric chromosomes can be formed during replication of circular bacterial chromosomes by an odd number of homologous recombination events between sister chromosomes. In the absence of a compensating recombination reaction such dimers cannot be segregated from each other as the cell divides. This review highlights the shared and divergent mechanisms employed by Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis in their effort to resolve and partition dimeric chromosomes safely. In particular, we discuss the Xer-type recombinases, RecA, FtsK/SpoIIIE, and dif.
