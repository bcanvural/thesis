Highly repetitive DNA sequences in cyanobacterial genomes.
We characterized three distinct families of repeated sequences in the genome of the cyanobacterium Calothrix sp. strain PCC 7601. These repeated sequences were present at a level of about 100 copies per Calothrix genome and consisted of tandemly amplified heptanucleotides. These elements were named short tandemly repeated repetitive (STRR) sequences. We used the three different Calothrix STRR sequences as probes to perform Southern hybridization experiments with DNAs extracted from various cyanobacterial strains, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli. The three different STRR sequences were found as repetitive genomic DNA components specific to the heterocystous strains tested. The role of the STRR sequences, as well as their possible use in taxonomic studies, is discussed.
