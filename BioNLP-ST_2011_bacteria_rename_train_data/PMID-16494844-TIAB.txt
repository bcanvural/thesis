Characterization of the Soj/Spo0J chromosome segregation proteins and identification of putative parS sequences in Helicobacter pylori.
The Soj and Spo0J proteins, together with one or more parS sequences, are crucial to chromosome segregation and the progression of cell cycle in many bacteria. In Helicobacter pylori, genes coding for Soj and a plasmid replication-partition-related protein containing a Spo0J or ParB conserved domain, together with two putative parS sites identified in this study, were found to be located within the origin-proximal 20-30% of the circular chromosome. Recombinant H. pylori Spo0J bound specifically to the two putative parS sequences and that of Bacillus subtilis. In addition, hydrolysis of ATP by H. pylori Soj was accelerated in the presence of parS and/or Spo0J. Protein-protein interactions, intracellular levels, and subcellular localization of Soj and Spo0J were analyzed through polyclonal antibodies directed against recombinant Soj and Spo0J. This study was the first implication of the existence of a functional parABS system in H. pylori.
