Characterization of Bacillus subtilis recombinational pathways.
Recombination in Bacillus subtilis requires the products of numerous rec loci. To dissect the various mechanisms which may be involved in genetic recombination, we constructed a series of isogenic strains containing more than one mutant rec allele. On the basis of their impairment in genetic exchange, the various loci (represented by specific rec alleles) were classified into different epistatic groups. Group alpha consists of rec genes represented by recB, recD, recF, recG, recL, and recR mutations, while group beta comprises the addA and addB mutations. Group gamma consists of the recH and recP mutations. These results suggest that B. subtilis has multiple pathways for genetic recombination and that the products of the genes within the alpha, beta, and gamma epistatic groups are involved in these alternative recombination pathways. The RecA protein is required in all three pathways of intermolecular recombination.
