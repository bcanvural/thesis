The glucose permease of the phosphotransferase system of Bacillus subtilis: evidence for IIGlc and IIIGlc domains.
Glucose is taken up in Bacillus subtilis via the phosphoenolpyruvate:glucose phosphotransferase system (glucose PTS). Two genes, orfG and ptsX, have been implied in the glucose-specific part of this PTS, encoding an Enzyme IIGlc and an Enzyme IIIGlc, respectively. We now show that the glucose permease consists of a single, membrane-bound, polypeptide with an apparent molecular weight of 80,000, encoded by a single gene which will be designated ptsG. The glucose permease contains domains that are 40-50% identical to the IIGlc and IIIGlc proteins of Escherichia coli. The B. subtilis IIIGlc domain can replace IIIGlc in E. coli crr mutants in supporting growth on glucose and transport of methyl alpha-glucoside. Mutations in the IIGlc and IIIGlc domains of the B. subtilis ptsG gene impaired growth on glucose and in some cases on sucrose. ptsG mutants lost all methyl alpha-glucoside transport but retained part of the glucose-transport capacity. Residual growth on glucose and transport of glucose in these ptsG mutants suggested that yet another uptake system for glucose existed, which is either another PT system or regulated by the PTS. The glucose PTS did not seem to be involved in the regulation of the uptake or metabolism of non-PTS compounds like glycerol. In contrast to ptsl mutants in members of the Enterobacteriaceae, the defective growth of B. subtilis ptsl mutants on glycerol was not restored by an insertion in the ptsG gene which eliminated IIGlc. Growth of B. subtilis ptsG mutants, lacking IIGlc, was not impaired on glycerol. From this we concluded that neither non-phosphorylated nor phosphorylated IIGlc was acting as an inhibitor or an activator, respectively, of glycerol uptake and metabolism.
