Characterization of PrpC from Bacillus subtilis, a member of the PPM phosphatase family.
We cloned the yloO gene and purified a His-tagged form of its product, the putative protein phosphatase YloO, which we now designate PrpC. This closely resembles the human protein phosphatase PP2C, a member of the PPM family, in sequence and predicted secondary structure. PrpC has phosphatase activity in vitro against a synthetic substrate, p-nitrophenol phosphate, and endogenous Bacillus subtilis proteins. The prkC and prpC genes are adjacent on the chromosome, and the phosphorylated form of PrkC is a substrate for PrpC. These findings suggest that PrkC and PrpC may function as a couple in vivo.
