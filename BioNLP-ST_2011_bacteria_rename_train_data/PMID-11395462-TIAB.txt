Localization of a germinant receptor protein (GerBA) to the inner membrane of Bacillus subtilis spores.
Dormant Bacillus subtilis spores germinate in response to specific nutrients called germinants, which are recognized by multisubunit receptor complexes encoded by members of the gerA family of operons, of which the gerB operon is a member. The germinant receptors are expected to be membrane associated, but there is some debate about whether they are located in the inner or outer spore membrane. In this study we have used Western blot analysis to determine the precise location of GerBA, a gerB-encoded receptor protein, in various spore fractions. GerBA was not extracted from spores by a decoating treatment that removes the coat and outer membrane but was present in lysates from decoated spores and in the insoluble fraction (termed P100) from such lysates that contained inner-membrane vesicles. GerBA was also solubilized from the P100 fraction with detergent but not with high salt. These findings suggest that GerBA is an integral membrane protein located in the spore's inner membrane. Consistent with this idea, GerBA was present in the cell membrane of the outgrowing spore, a membrane that is derived from the dormant spore's inner membrane. Based on these observations we propose that GerBA and probably the entire GerB germinant receptor are located in the inner membrane of the dormant spore. We also estimated that there are only 24 to 40 molecules of GerBA per spore, a number that is consistent with the previously reported low level of gerB operon expression and with the putative receptor function of the proteins encoded by the gerB operon.
