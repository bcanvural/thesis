Genetic analysis of the flaA locus of Bacillus subtilis.
We isolated two clones of recombinant lambda bacteriophage with overlapping inserts of Bacillus subtilis chromosomal DNA corresponding to part of the flaA locus. The flaA4 and flaA15 mutations were localized on the physical map by marker rescue experiments. The flaA locus and the flaB (sigD) gene were mapped in transduction crosses, and the order glnA polC flaB flaA was determined. FlaB was linked to polC in transformation crosses.
