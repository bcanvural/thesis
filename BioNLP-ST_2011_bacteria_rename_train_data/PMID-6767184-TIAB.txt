Mutagenicity screening of feed additives in the microbial system. 18 feed additives were tested for DNA-modifying effects by the repair test named "rec-assay" with Bacillus subtillis H17 (rec+) and M45 (rec-), and for mutagenicity with Escherichia coli WP2 hcr and 5 Salmonella typhimurium tester strains with the use of a top-agar overlay method. Carbadox, furazolidone, panazon and zoalene were positive in both assays. The former 3 were mutagenic for TA100, TA98 and WP2 hcr, while zoalene was mutagenic for all strains. These 4 compounds did not require a metabolic activation for their mutagenic activities. Nicarbazin was weakly mutagenic for TA1538 and TA98 with and without S9 mix. Amprolium and caprylohydroxamic acid also showed very weak mutagenicities only for TA100 with S9 mix and for WP2 hcr with and without S9 mix, resp. The mutagenic activities of carbadox, furazolidone and panazon for TA100 were reduced only by the addition of S9 mix, but not by S9 fraction or blood, whereas that of zoalene was decreased by any of the 3 factors.
