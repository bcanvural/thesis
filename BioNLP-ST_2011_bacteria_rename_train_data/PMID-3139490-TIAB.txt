Gene encoding a morphogenic protein required in the assembly of the outer coat of the Bacillus subtilis endospore.
Endospores of Bacillus subtilis are encased in a two-layer protein shell known as the coat, which consists of a lammellar-like inner layer and an electron-dense outer layer. We report the cloning of the structural gene (designated cotE) for an alkali-soluble coat protein of 24 kD and show that the cotE gene product is a morphogenic protein required in the assembly of the outer coat. The nucleotide sequence of cotE reveals an open reading frame capable of encoding a 181-residue-long polypeptide of 21 kD. A cotE mutant was created by replacing the chromosomal gene, which was located at 145 degrees on the chromosome, with an in vitro constructed, deletion-mutated gene. The resulting cotE mutant formed normal-looking (optically refractile) spores that were heat resistant but were sensitive to lysozyme and somewhat impaired in germination. Ultrastructural analysis indicated that the mutant spores lacked the electron-dense outer layer of the coat but retained a normal-looking inner coat. The mutant spores were pleiotropically deficient in several coat proteins, including the product of cotE and the products of previously cloned cot genes A-C. Based on experiments in which expression of the cotA and cotC genes was found to be unimpaired in cotE mutant cells, we infer that the cotE gene product is involved in the assembly of the products of cotA-cotC, and certain other proteins into the electron-dense outer layer of the coat.
