Mutants of Bacillus subtilis defective in protein export.
We have isolated a set of strains with mutations (designated prs) that decrease secretion of alpha-amylase and have a pleiotropic effect on secretion of other exoproteins. The seven mutants were selected in a strain of Bacillus subtilis which overproduces alpha-amylase due to the presence of an alpha-amylase gene on a multicopy plasmid. The mutations were mapped to four different chromosomal loci. The phenotype of the mutants, especially their pleiotropic effects and the accumulation of alpha-amylase precursor, indicated that they have defects in the mechanism of protein export. Double mutants with certain pairwise combinations of mutations in different loci had additive effects on secretion, suggesting that these prs genes encode different components of the secretion pathway.
