Deduced amino-acid sequence and possible catalytic residues of a novel pectate lyase from an alkaliphilic strain of Bacillus.
The nucleotide sequence of the gene for a highly alkaline, low-molecular-mass pectate lyase (Pel-15) from an alkaliphilic Bacillus isolate was determined. It harbored an open reading frame of 672 bp encoding the mature enzyme of 197 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 20 924 Da. The deduced amino-acid sequence of the mature enzyme showed very low homology (< 20.4% identity) to those of known pectinolytic enzymes in the large pectate lyase superfamily (the polysaccharide lyase family 1). In an integrally conserved region designated the BF domain, Pel-15 showed a high degree of identity (40.5% to 79.4%) with pectate lyases in the polysaccharide lyase family 3, such as PelA, PelB, PelC, and PelD from Fusarium solani f. sp. pisi, PelB from Erwinia carotovora ssp. carotovora, PelI from E. chrysanthemi, and PelA from a Bacillus strain. By site-directed mutagenesis of the Pel-15 gene, we replaced Lys20 in the N-terminal region, Glu38, Lys41, Glu47, Asp63, His66, Trp78, Asp80, Glu83, Asp84, Lys89, Asp106, Lys107, Asp126, Lys129, and Arg132 in the BF domain, and Arg152, Tyr174, Lys182, and Lys185 in the C-terminal region of the enzyme individually with Ala and/or other amino acids. Consequently, some carboxylate and basic residues selected from Glu38, Asp63, Glu83, Asp106, Lys107, Lys129, and Arg132 were suggested to be involved in catalysis and/or calcium binding. We constructed a chimeric enzyme composed of Ala1 to Tyr105 of Pel-15 in the N-terminal regions, Asp133 to Arg159 of FsPelB in the internal regions, and Gln133 to Tyr197 of Pel-15 in the C-terminal regions. The substituted PelB segment could also express beta-elimination activity in the chimeric molecule, confirming that Pel-15 and PelB share a similar active-site topology.
