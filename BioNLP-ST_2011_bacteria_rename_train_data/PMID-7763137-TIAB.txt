Analysis of the genes forming the distal parts of the two cbb CO2 fixation operons from Alcaligenes eutrophus.
In the facultative chemoautotroph Alcaligenes eutrophus H16, most of the genes (cbb genes) encoding enzymes of the Calvin carbon reduction cycle are organized within two highly homologous cbb operons, one located on the chromosome and the other on the megaplasmid pHG1. Nucleotide sequencing of the promoter-distal part of the operons revealed three open reading frames, designated cbbG, cbbK, and cbbA. Similarity searches in databases and heterologous expressions of the subcloned genes in Escherichia coli identified them as genes encoding the Calvin cycle enzymes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, and a class II fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, respectively. The aldolase could be grouped together with the enzymes from Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Bacillus subtilis as a new subtype of class II aldolases. A phenotypic complementation analysis with a cbb operon mutant of A. eutrophus showed that the cbbG product is essential for autotrophic growth of the organism, whereas the products of cbbK and cbbA can apparently be substituted by isoenzymes encoded elsewhere on the chromosome. No or only low constitutive promoter activity was associated with cbbK and cbbA, respectively, confirming the two genes as parts of the cbb operon. Downstream of cbbA, the very high overall nucleotide sequence identity (about 94%) prevailing throughout the two cbb operons discontinues, suggesting that cbbA is the most promoter-distal gene of the operon.
