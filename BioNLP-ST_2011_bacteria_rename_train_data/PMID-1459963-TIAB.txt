Properties of purified sporlets produced by spoII mutants of Bacillus subtilis.
A number of abortively disporic spoII mutants of Bacillus subtilis released their forespore compartments (termed stage II sporlets) after mother cell lysis during sporulation in nutrient exhaustion or resuspension media. Stage II sporlets were viable and contained levels of ATP and a number of enzymes similar to those in cells 2 to 3 h after sporulation. However, stage II sporlets carried out essentially no macromolecular synthesis, a result suggesting that they were in a quiescent state. The nucleoid of these quiescent stage II sporlets was significantly condensed relative to that in the original vegetative cells, as was previously found to take place 1 to 2 h after initiation of sporulation (B. Setlow, N. Magill, P. Febbroriello, L. Nakhimousky, D. E. Koppel, and P. Setlow, J. Bacteriol. 173:6270-6278, 1991). Stage II sporlets may be a useful model system for analysis of forespore properties early in stage II of sporulation.
