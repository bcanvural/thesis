A gene encoding a tyrosine tRNA synthetase is located near sacS in Bacillus subtilis.
Within the frame of an attempt to sequence the whole Bacillus subtilis genome, a region of 5.5 kbp of the B. subtilis chromosome near the sacS locus has been sequenced. It contains five complete coding sequences, including the sequence of sacY, three unknown CDS and a sequence coding for a tyrosine tRNA synthetase. That the corresponding CDS encodes a functional synthetase has been demonstrated by complementation of an Escherichia coli mutant possessing a thermosensitive tRNA synthetase. Insertion of a kanamycin resistance cassette in the B. subtilis chromosome at the corresponding locus resulted, however, in no apparent phenotype, demonstrating that this synthetase is dispensable. Finally phylogenetic relationships between known tyrosine and tryptophan tRNA synthetases are discussed.
