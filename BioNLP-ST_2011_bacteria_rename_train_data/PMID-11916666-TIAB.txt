Cloning of rel from Listeria monocytogenes as an osmotolerance involvement gene.
Transposon insertional mutants of Listeria monocytogenes were constructed to identify genes involved in osmotolerance, and one mutant that showed reduced growth under high osmotic pressure was obtained. The cloned gene from the transposon insertion site of the mutant, named rel, was 2,214 bp in length and had very high homology to relA of Bacillus subtilis, which encodes guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp) and guanosine pentaphosphate (pppGpp) [collectively designated (p)ppGpp] synthetase during stringent response. The mutant showed a deficiency in (p)ppGpp accumulation. In the parental strain, the amount of intracellular (p)ppGpp was not increased after an osmotic upshift but was slightly decreased compared with the level before the upward shift. The reduced osmotolerance of the mutant was restored to a level almost equal to that of the parent strain when the chromosomal region that included rel of L. monocytogenes was introduced into the mutant. After exposure to methyl glucoside, the rel mutant accumulated (p)ppGpp at a higher level than the basal level and partially restored the ability to grow in NaCl-supplemented brain heart infusion broth. The mutant was found to grow in chemically defined minimal medium supplemented with glycine betaine or carnitine, so-called compatible solutes, and 4% NaCl. Our results suggest that the appropriate intracellular concentration of (p)ppGpp is essential for full osmotolerance in L. monocytogenes and that its mechanism is different from that for the accumulation of compatible solutes.
