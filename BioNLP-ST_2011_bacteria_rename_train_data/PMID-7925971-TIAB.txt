Confirmation of the existence of a third family among peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases.
Amino acid sequence and recombinant production of parvulin. In addition to the major cyclophilin-like peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases (PPIases) of Escherichia coli an enzyme of very low relative molecular mass (10.1 kDa) was discovered in this organism which gave first indication of the existence of a novel family in this enzyme class [1994, FEBS Lett. 343, 65-69]. In the present report we describe the chemically determined amino acid sequence of four peptides derived from the 10.1 kDa protein by the treatment with either cyanogen bromide or endoproteinase Lys-C. Together with a continuous run of 75 amino acids starting N-terminally, the sequence of the mature enzyme, 92 residues in length, was elucidated. Cloning and determination of the primary structure of a DNA fragment encoding this enzyme were also performed. Overexpression of the enzyme by using multicopies of plasmid pSEP38 in E. coli and detecting an enhanced PPIase activity attributed to the 10.1 kDa enzyme provided additional proof that the 92 amino acid protein was a PPIase. The enzyme was called parvulin (lat.: parvulus, very small). Homology analyses indicated that several parvulin-like proteins could be found in the database screened. To further elucidate the functional role of PPIases it might be of some importance that homologous proteins like the PrtM protein of Lactococcus lactis and the PrsA lipoprotein of Bacillus subtilis are known to be involved in the protein export and maturation machinery of the bacteria.
