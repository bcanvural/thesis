Molecular cloning and characterization of the Bacillus subtilis spore photoproduct lyase (spl) gene, which is involved in repair of UV radiation-induced DNA damage during spore germination.
Upon UV irradiation, Bacillus subtilis spore DNA accumulates the novel thymine dimer 5-thyminyl-5,6-dihydrothymine. Spores can repair this "spore photoproduct" (SP) upon germination either by the uvr-mediated general excision repair pathway or by the SP-specific spl pathway, which involves in situ monomerization of SP to two thymines by an enzyme named SP lyase. Mutants lacking both repair pathways produce spores that are extremely sensitive to UV. For cloning DNA that can repair a mutation in the spl pathway called spl-1, a library of EcoRI fragments of chromosomal DNA from B. subtilis 168 was constructed in integrative plasmid pJH101 and introduced by transformation into a mutant B. subtilis strain that carries both the uvrA42 and spl-1 mutations, and transformants whose spores exhibited UV resistance were selected by UV irradiation. With a combination of genetic and physical mapping techniques, the DNA responsible for the restoration of UV resistance was shown to be present on a 2.3-kb EcoRI-HindIII fragment that was mapped to a new locus in the metC-pyrD region of the B. subtilis chromosome immediately downstream from the pstI gene. The spl coding sequence was localized on the cloned fragment by analysis of in vitro-generated deletions and by nucleotide sequencing. The spl nucleotide sequence contains an open reading frame capable of encoding a 40-kDa polypeptide that shows regional amino acid sequence homology to DNA photolyases from a number of bacteria and fungi.
