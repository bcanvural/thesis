Genetic mapping of katA, a locus that affects catalase 1 level in Bacillus subtilis.
Several mutants of Bacillus subtilis deficient in catalase synthesis generated by nitrosoguanidine mutagenesis have been used to map a locus affecting catalase activity. Two- and three-factor bacteriophage PBS1 transductional crosses were used to locate the locus, named katA, between recH and thiA with 98% linkage to thiA at 70 degrees on the B. subtilis genome. The synthesis of catalase 1, found only in vegetative cells, was affected by katA.
