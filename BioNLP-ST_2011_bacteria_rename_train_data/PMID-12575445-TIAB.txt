[Identification and cloning of peptide synthetase genes of thermostable bacilli using the polymerase chain reaction] Fourteen thermophilic and thermostable strains of the genus Bacillus were studied.
Total DNA was isolated from these strains and used as a template to identify and clone peptide synthetase genes by means of polymerase chain reaction. Amplified DNA fragments were cloned into a phasmid vector, and nucleotide sequences of cloned fragments were determined. Stringent thermophilic strains were shown to lack genetic systems, which are responsible for the synthesis of secondary metabolites and homologous to the known peptide synthetase genes. On the contrary, thermostable strains had peptide synthetases and produced antimicrobial secondary metabolites. Analysis of nucleotide sequences and deduced amino acid sequences of cloned PCR fragments from B. licheniformis strains VK2, VK21, and VK2101 showed that they are absolutely identical. The cloned DNA fragment was found to be a portion of the open reading frame, which we termed ORF1. Data from analysis of a partial nucleotide sequence of the peptide synthetase gene of strain VK21 indicated that a 9.5-kb region of chromosomal DNA contains sequences of two genes homologous to the B. subtilis peptide synthetase genes dhbB and dhbF. Strains VK2, VK21, and VK2101 were shown to synthesize siderophores. A method for screening bacteria with peptide synthetase genes has been developed.
