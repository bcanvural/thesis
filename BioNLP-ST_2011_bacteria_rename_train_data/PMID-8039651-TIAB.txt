Genetic analysis of the DnaA-dependent priming in the initiation of lagging strand DNA synthesis of plasmid pUB110 in Bacillus subtilis.
Derivatives of Bacillus subtilis plasmid pUB110 lacking the major lagging strand replication origin (ssoU-) accumulate intracellular single-strand circular (SS(c)) DNA intermediates and are unable to propagate in dnaB and dnaD hosts. DnaA-dependent priming requires a DnaA box in a stable hairpin form; a higher copy number of a DnaA box is not sufficient as a signal for the conversion of the SS(c) into its dsDNA form. The introduction into the plasmid of a hairpin structure, whose stem carries a DnaA box, mediates conversion of SS(c) into dsDNA and makes plasmid replication independent of the B. subtilis dnaB function. This conversion signal has been termed ssoA.
