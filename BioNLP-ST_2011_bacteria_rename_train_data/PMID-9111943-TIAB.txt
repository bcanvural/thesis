Molecular cloning and analysis of a HSP (heat shock protein)-like 42 kDa antigen gene of Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae.
The recombinant clone expressing the 42 kDa protein (P42) of Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae in Escherichia coli was analyzed. The 4.4 kb HindIII-Xmal DNA fragment expressing the p42 gene product encodes three ORFs: p42 and p16 in the forwarding strand, p24 in the reverse strand. Sequence comparisons revealed that p42 could be part of a p65 gene, and has 62% identities with Mycoplasma genitalium HSP70 gene and 56% identities with Bacillus subtilis dnaK gene; p16 and p24 genes share 73% and 47% identities with Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae dnaJ gene and Pseudomonas fluorescens uvrC gene, respectively. Further analysis demonstrated that P42 is indeed a heat shock protein and the monospecific antibodies against P42 can block the growth of Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae.
