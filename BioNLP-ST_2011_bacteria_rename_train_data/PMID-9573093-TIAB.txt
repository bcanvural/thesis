Identification of a homolog of CcpA catabolite repressor protein in Streptococcus mutans.
A locus containing a gene with homology to ccpA of other bacteria has been cloned from Streptococcus mutans LT11, sequenced, and named regM. Upstream of the regM gene, on the opposite strand, is a gene encoding an X-Pro dipeptidase, pepQ. A 14-bp palindromic sequence with homology to the consensus catabolite-responsive element sequence lay in the promoter region between the two genes. To study the function of regM, the gene was inactivated by insertion of an antibiotic resistance marker. Diauxic growth of S. mutans on a number of sugars in the presence of glucose was not affected by disruption of regM. The loss of RegM increased glucose repression of alpha-galactosidase, mannitol-1-P dehydrogenase, and P-beta-galactosidase activities. These results suggest that while RegM can affect catabolite repression in S. mutans, it does not conform to the model proposed for CcpA in Bacillus subtilis.
