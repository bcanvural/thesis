Functional cloning of the dihydropteroate synthase gene of Staphylococcus haemolyticus.
A 1,7-kilobase fragment of the Staphylococcus haemolyticus chromosome containing the dihydropteroate synthase gene has been cloned by complementation in a temperature-sensitive mutant of Escherichia coli. The gene, designated folP, predicts a gene product of 29613 Da which shares significant amino acid sequence identity with other known bacterial dihydropteroate synthases. Analysis of the DNA sequence upstream and downstream of folP identified two further, incomplete open reading frames, one of which shows predicted amino acid sequence similarity to a second bacterial folic acid synthesis enzyme, dihydroneopterin aldolase.
