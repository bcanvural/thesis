Genetic engineering of Escherichia coli for production of tetrahydrobiopterin.
Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is an essential cofactor for various enzymes in mammals. In vivo, it is synthesized from GTP via the three-step pathway of GTP cyclohydrolase I (GCHI), 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin synthase (PTPS) and sepiapterin reductase (SPR). BH4 is a medicine used to treat atypical hyperphenylalaninemia. It is currently synthesized by chemical means, which consists of many steps, and requires costly materials and complicated procedures. To explore an alternative microbial method for BH4 production, we utilized recombinant DNA technology to construct recombinant Escherichia coli (E. coli) strains carrying genes expressing GCHI, PTPS and SPR enzymes. These strains successfully produced BH4, which was detected as dihydrobiopterin and biopterin, oxidation products of BH4. In order to increase BH4 productivity we made further improvements. First, to increase the de novo GTP supply, an 8-azaguanine resistant mutant was isolated and an additional guaBA operon was introduced. Second, to augment the activity of GCHI, the folE gene from E. coli was replaced by the mtrA gene from Bacillus subtilis. These modifications provided us with a strain showing significantly higher productivity, up to 4.0 g of biopterin/L of culture broth. The results suggest the possibility of commercial BH4 production by our method.
