Identification of dinR, a DNA damage-inducible regulator gene of Bacillus subtilis.
A Bacillus subtilis strain deficient in homologous recombination was isolated from a library of Tn917lac insertion mutants. The interrupted locus consists of an open reading frame encoding a 22,823-dalton polypeptide. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence revealed 34% identity and 47.3% similarity with the LexA protein from Escherichia coli. The gene was designated dinR. It is located between the recA and thyA genetic markers, at 162 degrees on the B. subtilis chromosome. The dinR gene was shown to be expressed during the entire B. subtilis cellular cycle with at least a threefold increase when cells develop competence. In addition, the use of a merodiploid strain, in which a copy of the wild-type dinR gene coexists with a dinR-lacZ transcriptional fusion, demonstrated that dinR is an SOS gene and that the SOS-induced expression of dinR occurred only when a wild-type copy of dinR was present. In addition, DinR seems to regulate the expression of dinC, another SOS gene.
