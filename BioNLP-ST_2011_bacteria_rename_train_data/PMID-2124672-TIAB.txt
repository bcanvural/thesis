Molecular cloning, genetic characterization and DNA sequence analysis of the recM region of Bacillus subtilis.
In Bacillus subtilis the recM gene, whose product is associated with DNA repair and recombination, has been located between the dnaX and rrnA genes. The recM gene has been cloned and analyzed. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence (3.741-kilobase) around recM revealed five open reading frames (orf). We have assigned recM and dnaX to two of this orf, given the gene order dnaX-orf107-recM-orf74-orf87. The organization of genes of the dnaX-orf107-recM region resembles the organization of genes in the dnaX-orf12-recR region of the Escherichia coli chromosome. Proteins of 24.2 and 17.0 kDa would result from translation of the wild type and in vitro truncated recM genes, and radioactive bands of proteins of molecular weights of 24.5 and 17.0 kDa were detected by the use of the T7promoter-expression system. The RecM protein contains a potential zinc finger domain for nucleic acid binding and a putative nucleotide binding sequence that is present in many proteins that bind and hydrolyze ATP. Strains, in which the recM gene has been insertionally inactivated, were generated and show a phenotype essentially the same as previously described recM mutants.
