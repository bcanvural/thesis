p-Aminobenzoate-p-aminobenzoate. p-Aminobenzoate (PABA) synthase from Bacillus subtilis is an aggregate composed of two nonidentical subunits and has the following properties. (i) In crude extracts this enzyme catalyzes the formation of PABA in the presence of chorismate and either glutamine (amidotransferase) or ammonia (aminase). The amidotransferase activity is about 5- to 10-fold higher than the aminase activity and is stable for at least 1 week when frozen at -70 C. (II) Although no divalent cation requirement could be demonstrated with crude extracts, 2 mM ethylene-diaminetetraacetic acid completely inhibits both activities. (iii) After ammonium sulfate fractionation both the aminase and amidotransferase activities require Mg2+ and guanosine in addition to the substrates indicated above for optimal activity. The guanosine requirement can be replaced by guanosine 5'-monophosphate, guanosine 5'-diphosphate, and guanosine 5'-triphosphate but not by guanine, adenosine 5'-triphosphate, uridine 5'-triphosphate, cytidine 5'-triphosphate, thymidine 5'-triphosphate, inorganic phosphate, and phosphoribosylpyrophosphate. Furthermore, at a pH above 7.4 or below 6.4 activity is rapidly lost a 4 C, or -60 C. (IV) The enzyme is composed of two non-identical subunits, designated subunit A and subunit X. Subunit A has an estimated molecular weight of 31,000, whereas subunit X has an estimated molecular weight of 19,000. Subunit A has aminase activity but no amidotransferase activity; a mutation at the pabA locus results in the loss of PABA synthase activity. Subunit X, which is also a component of the anthranilate synthase complex, has no PABA synthase activity itself but complexes with subunit A to give an AX aggregate that can use glutamine as a substrate. (v) The molecular weight of the AX complex has been estimated at 50,000, suggesting a 1:1 ratio of subunits. (vi) The enzyme is readily associated and dissociated.
