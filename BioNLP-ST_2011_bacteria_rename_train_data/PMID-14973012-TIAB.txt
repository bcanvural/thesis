Characterization of two kinases involved in thiamine pyrophosphate and pyridoxal phosphate biosynthesis in Bacillus subtilis: 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2methylpyrimidine kinase and pyridoxal kinase.
Two Bacillus subtilis genes encoding two proteins (currently annotated ThiD and YjbV) were overexpressed and characterized. YjbV has 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine and 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine pyrophosphate kinase activity and should be reannotated ThiD, and B. subtilis ThiD has pyridoxine, pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine kinase activity and should be reannotated PdxK.
