Molecular cloning of a Bacillus subtilis gene involved in cell division, sporulation, and exoenzyme secretion.
The wild type div-341+ gene of Bacillus subtilis was cloned in a temperate phage rho 11, and was recloned in a smaller temperate phage phi 105. The resulting Div+ transducing phage carried a 3 kilobase Cfr13I digested chromosomal fragment which showed Div+ transforming activity and contained the whole div-341+ gene which is involved in cell division, sporulation, exoenzyme secretion, competent cell formation, and autolysis. A partial restriction map of the fragment was established. The merodiploid system of the div-341+ gene, wild type gene on the phage genome and mutant gene on the chromosome, resulted in the suppression of mutant phenotypes and indicated that the wild type div-341+ gene is dominant over mutant gene.
