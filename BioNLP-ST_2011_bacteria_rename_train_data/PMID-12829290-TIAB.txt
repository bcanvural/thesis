Differences in effects on DNA gyrase activity between two glutamate racemases of Bacillus subtilis, the poly-gamma-glutamate synthesis-linking Glr enzyme and the YrpC (MurI) isozyme.
Bacillus subtilis possesses two isogenes encoding glutamate racemases, the poly-gamma-glutamate synthesis-linking Glr enzyme and the YrpC isozyme, and produces abundant amounts of the Glr enzyme. The YrpC isozyme, but not the Glr enzyme, was found to influence the activity of DNA gyrase, as did the MurI-type glutamate racemase of Escherichia coli, which is involved in peptidoglycan synthesis during cell division.
