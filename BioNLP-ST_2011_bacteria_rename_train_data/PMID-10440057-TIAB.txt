Evaluation of an rDNA Listeria probe for Listeria monocytogenes typing.
A Listeria monocytogenes DNA fragment, identified as part of the 23S rRNA gene and called B17, was used to type 266 L. monocytogenes strains and 43 strains of other Listeria species. Results were compared with those obtained: i) with pBA2 (which consists of a 2.3 kb Bacillus subtilis DNA fragment encoding 16S rRNA, inserted into the HindIII site of pBR322), a probe previously used for Listeria and L. monocytogenes ribotyping, and ii) with DNA macrorestriction profiles analysis. Twenty profiles were identified for L. monocytogenes using pB 17, three of which accounted for 87% of strains. This new rDNA probe had greater discriminatory power for serogroups 1/2 or 3 strains than for serogroup 4 strains. The number of varieties and the discrimination index were higher with this new probe than with pBA2, but DNA macrorestriction patterns analysis gave better discrimination between strains.
