[Role of the systems of DNA dark repair in determining bacterial and phage sensitivity to ultraviolet radiation in an ecological long-wave range] A comparison has been made of sensitivity to far (254 nm), middle (300--315 nm) and near (315--400 nm) UV radiation of 12 strains of E. coli and 2 strains of B. subtilis differing in DNA dark repair (DR) capability. The mechanisms controlled by uvrA, uvrB, polA, recA, lon, and lexA genes are very effective in cells, irradiated by far and middle UV, but by 15--70% less effective in those irradiated by near UV. As the unirradiated bacteria poorly repair the near UV damaged phages (T7, lambda, SPPI), the low bacterial DR level after UV irradiation seems to be due to the unrepairable photoproduct formation in DNA.
