Expression of the recE gene during induction of the SOS response in Bacillus subtilis recombination-deficient strains.
A transcriptional fusion of the recE gene to a reporter gene has been constructed. Expression of recE was found to be induced upon damage to DNA with either mitomycin C or nalidixic acid. This specific transcriptional induction is blocked by a recE mutation. Mutations affecting the recB, recF and recL gene products markedly reduced induction. However, derepression of recE seems to be independent of the ATP-dependent DNase activity of the exonuclease V enzyme (also called AddAB enzyme).
