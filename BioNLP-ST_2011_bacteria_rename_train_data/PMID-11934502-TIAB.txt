Investigation of the yvgW Bacillus subtilis chromosomal gene involved in Cd(2+) ion resistance.
Analysis of the complete genome sequence of Bacillus subtilis has identified the gene yvgW encoding a protein of 703 amino acids with sequence similarity to the cadmium resistance determinant CadA from the Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pI258. Deletion of yvgW (designated cadA) resulted in increased sensitivity of the strain to cadmium. The cadA gene is expressed from its own promoter, and its expression is induced by cadmium. Northern hybridization analysis showed that cadmium induces the synthesis of a 2.2-kb cadA transcript. These results indicate that cadA is the chromosomal determinant to cadmium resistance in B. subtilis.
