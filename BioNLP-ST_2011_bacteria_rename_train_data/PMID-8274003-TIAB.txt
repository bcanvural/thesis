Characterization of the heat shock response in Enterococcus faecalis.
We have characterized the general properties of the heat shock response of the Gram-positive hardy bacterium Enterococcus faecalis. The heat resistance (60 degrees C or 62.5 degrees C, 30 min) of log phase cells of E. faecalis grown at 37 degrees C was enhanced by exposing cells to a prior heat shock at 45 degrees C or 50 degrees C for 30 min. These conditioning temperatures also induced ethanol (22%, v/v) tolerance. The onset of thermotolerance was accompanied by the synthesis of a number of heat shock proteins. The most prominent bands had molecular weights in the range of 48 to 94kDa. By Western blot analysis two of them were found to be immunologically related to the well known DnaK (72kDa) and GroEL (63kDa) heat shock proteins of Escherichia coli. Four other proteins showing little or no variations after exposure to heat are related to DnaJ, GrpE and Lon (La) E. coli proteins and to the Bacillus subtilis sigma 43 factor. Ethanol (2% or 4%, v/v) treatments elicited a similar response although there was a weaker induction of heat shock proteins than with heat shock.
