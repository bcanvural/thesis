Mutagenic and membranal effect of a phytotoxic molecule isolated from olive leaves parasitized by the fungus Cycloconium oleaginum Cast.
A phytotoxic substance (C23H44O3) which is named 'Substance A', was purified from olive leaves infected with Cycloconium oleaginum Cast. The mutagenic effect of this substance was detected using TA 100 and TA 102 strains of Salmonella in the Ames test using Bacillus subtilis strains M45 rec-, H17 rec+ in the rec assay. Another substance manifesting the mutagenic effect was found in the extract from the Cycloconium oleaginum culture. This substance was not detected in the extract from contaminated olive leaves. Substance A increased electrolytes leakage from tissue of olive leaves, thus manifesting its phytotoxicity.
