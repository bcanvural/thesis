Association of the histone-like protein HBsu with the nucleoid of Bacillus subtilis.
To investigate the physiological role of the essential histone-like protein of Bacillus subtilis (HBsu) in the nucleoid structure, a fusion to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) of Aequorea victoria was constructed. This purified fusion protein, HBsuGFP, showed a threefold-reduced affinity to DNA compared to unmodified HBsu; however, in gel mobility shift experiments HBsuGFP DNA-binding was greatly enhanced in the presence of low HBsu concentrations. Additional production of HBsu also had a positive effect on the retarded growth of a B. subtilis strain, PK9C8, which expresses only hbs-gfp (encoding HBsuGFP). HBsu seemed to influence not only growth but also nucleoid structure, as monitored by DNA staining and fluorescence microscopy. Without HBsu production, strain PK9C8 showed a relaxed nucleoid structure associated with HBsuGFP. However, a highly compact nucleoid structure that coincides with the fluorescence of the fusion protein was visualized when HBsu synthesis was induced. This provides the first evidence for in vivo association of HBsu in DNA packaging and its consequence on cell growth.
