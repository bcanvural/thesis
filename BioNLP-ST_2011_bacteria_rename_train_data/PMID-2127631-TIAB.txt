The molecular structure of the Corynebacterium glutamicum threonine synthase gene.
The minimal region encoding the Corynebacterium glutamicum threonine synthase structural gene and its promoter was mapped by deletion analysis and complementation of the C. glutamicum thrC allele to a 1.6 kb region of the recombinant plasmid pFS80. The nucleotide sequence of this and flanking DNA was determined. The transcription and translation start points were identified by S1 mapping analysis and amino-terminal protein sequencing, respectively. The thrC gene encodes a 54481-Dalton polypeptide product. Translation of the thrC mRNA initiates only six nucleotides downstream from transcription. The length of the mRNA transcript is consistent with a single gene transcription unit. The C. glutamicum thrC gene is expressed independently of the other threonine-specific genes hom and thrB.
