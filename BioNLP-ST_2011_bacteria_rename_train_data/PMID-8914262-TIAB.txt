Molecular analysis of the rpoD gene of Enterococcus faecalis.
The complete nucleotide sequence of the rpoD gene of Enterococcus faecalis ATCC19433 has been determined. This gene encodes a putative 368 amino acids (aa) polypeptide of a predicted Mr of 41842 named sigma 42. Upstream of the rpoD gene and beginning from the end of the cloned chromosomal fragment is an open reading frame encoding a putative 264-aa polypeptide. It is reminiscent of the C-terminal domain of known DNA primase from Gram-positive bacteria indicating that the E. faecalis rpoD gene is included in a macromolecular synthesis (MMS) operon, as it was described for Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Lactococcus lactis rpoD gene.
