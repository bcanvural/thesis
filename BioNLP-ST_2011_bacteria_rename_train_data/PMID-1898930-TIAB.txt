Regulation of spo0H, a gene coding for the Bacillus subtilis sigma H factor.
The Bacillus spo0H gene codes for sigma H, which, as part of the RNA polymerase holoenzyme E sigma H, is responsible for the transcription of several genes which are expressed at the beginning of the sporulation process. In this communication, we examined the regulation of the spo0H gene of Bacillus subtilis by using lacZ reporter gene assays, quantitative RNA determinations, and Western immunoassay. The expression of the spo0H gene increases as the culture enters the mid-logarithmic stage of growth. This increased expression requires the genes spo0A, spo0B, spo0E, and spo0F, and the requirement for at least spo0A and spo0B can be bypassed when the abrB gene is mutated. The expression of the spo0H gene is constitutive in the presence of the abrB mutation, being expressed at higher levels during vegetative growth. In addition, the sof-1 mutation, in the spo0A structural gene, can bypass the need for spo0F in spo0H expression. The transcriptional start site of spo0H was determined by using RNA made in vivo as well as in vitro. These studies indicate that spo0H is transcribed by the major vegetative RNA polymerase, E sigma A. spo0H RNA and sigma H levels during growth are not identical to each other or to the pattern of expression of spoVG, a gene transcribed by E sigma H. This suggests that spo0H is regulated posttranscriptionally and also that factors in addition to sigma H levels are involved in the expression of genes of the E sigma H regulon.
